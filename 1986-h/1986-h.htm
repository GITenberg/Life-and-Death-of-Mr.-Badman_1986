<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p><i>The Life and Death of Mr Badman</i> was published by John
Bunyan in 1680, two years after the First Edition of the First
Part of <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>.&nbsp; In the opening
sentence of his preface he tells us it was intended by him as the
counterpart or companion picture to the Allegory.&nbsp; But
whatever his own intentions may have been, the Public of his own
time seem to have declined to accept the book in this
capacity.&nbsp; Indeed, another writer, who signs himself T. S.,
undertook to complete Bunyan&rsquo;s Allegory for him, in a book
in size and type closely resembling it, and entitled <i>The
Second Part of the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress . . . exactly
Described under the Similitude of a Dream</i>.&nbsp; It was
printed for Jho. Malthus at the Sun in the Poultry, and published
in 1683.&nbsp; So far as is known, only one copy of this book is
now in existence, the copy which was formerly in the library of
the poet Southey and now in that of the Baptist Union.&nbsp; Upon
this Bunyan seems to have changed his purpose, so far as <i>The
Life and Death of Mr Badman</i> was concerned, and on the first
of January, 1685, published the story of Christiana and her
Children as his own Second Part of <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i>.</p>
<p>The work before us, therefore, now stands apart by
itself.&nbsp; In its composition Bunyan seems to have been
greatly influenced, so far as form is concerned, by a book which
his wife brought with her on her marriage, and which, as he tells
us in his <i>Grace Abounding</i>, they read together.&nbsp; It
was entitled <i>The Plaine Man&rsquo;s Pathway to Heaven</i>: By
Arthur Dent, Preacher of the Word of God at South Shoobury in
Essex.&nbsp; The eleventh impression, the earliest now known, is
dated 1609.&nbsp; Both books are in dialogue form, and in each
case the dialogue is supposed to be carried on through one long
day.&nbsp; Bunyan&rsquo;s <i>Mr Wiseman</i>, like Dent&rsquo;s
<i>Theologus</i>, holds forth instructive discourse, while the
<i>Mr Attentive</i> of the former, like the <i>Philagathus</i> of
the latter, listens and draws on his teacher by friendly
questionings.&nbsp; There is not in Bunyan&rsquo;s conference, as
there is in Dent&rsquo;s, an <i>Asunetus</i>, who plays the part
of an ignorant man to come out enlightened and convinced at last,
or an <i>Antilegon</i>, who carps and cavils all the way; and
there is not in Dent&rsquo;s book what there is in
Bunyan&rsquo;s, a biographical narrative connecting the various
parts of the dialogue; but the groundwork of each is the
same&mdash;a searching manifestation and exposure of the nature
and evils of various forms of immorality.</p>
<p>Bunyan&rsquo;s book came out in 1680, and was published by
Nathaniel Ponder, who was also the publisher of <i>The
Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>.&nbsp; A third edition appeared in
1696, but as no copy of the second edition is known to exist, no
date can be assigned to it.&nbsp; In 1684 Johannes Boekholt, a
publisher in Amsterdam, obtained leave of the State to issue a
Dutch translation, with the title <i>Het Leven en Sterben van Mr
Quaat</i>.&nbsp; This edition was illustrated by five
copper-plate engravings, executed by Jan Luiken, the eminent
Dutch engraver, who also illustrated <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i> the following year.&nbsp; In 1782 a Welsh version,
translated by T. Lewys, was published at Liverpool with the
title: <i>Bywyd a Marwolaeth yr annuwiol dan enw Mr
Drygddyn</i>.&nbsp; A Gaelic version also was published at
Inverness in 1824, entitled <i>Beath agus Bas Mhr
Droch-duine</i>.</p>
<p>The present edition has been reprinted from a copy of the
first issue, lent by the Trustees of the Bunyan Church at
Bedford, and the proofs read with a second copy of the same
issue, in the library of the British Museum.&nbsp; For
convenience of reading, as in other issues of this series of
<span class="smcap">Cambridge English Classics</span>, the old
type forms of <i>j</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>u</i>, etc. have been made
uniform with those in general modern use; but neither the
spelling (including the use of capitals and italics <a
name="citation1b"></a><a href="#footnote1b"
class="citation">[1b]</a>) nor the punctuation has been altered,
save as specified.&nbsp; Effect has been given to the errata
noted by Bunyan himself, and printed on page 15 of this
issue.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The text of this edition of Bunyan&rsquo;s <i>Holy War</i> <a
name="citation1a"></a><a href="#footnote1a"
class="citation">[1a]</a> is a careful reproduction of the First
Edition of 1682.&nbsp; It is not certain that there was any
further authentic reprint in Bunyan&rsquo;s life-time.&nbsp; For
though both in the Bodleian and the British Museum there is a
copy purporting to be a second edition, and bearing date 1684, it
is difficult to resist the impression that they are pirated
copies, similar to those of which Nathaniel Ponder complained so
bitterly in the case of <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i>.&nbsp; For both paper and typography are greatly
inferior to those of the first edition; some of Bunyan&rsquo;s
most characteristic marginalia are carelessly omitted;
Bunyan&rsquo;s own title&mdash;&lsquo;The Holy War made by
Shaddai upon Diabolus for the regaining of the Metropolis of the
World&rsquo;&mdash;is altered to the feebler and more commonplace
form&mdash;&lsquo;The Holy War made by Christ upon the Devil for
the Regaining of Man&rsquo;; and, further, when a new edition was
issued in 1696, the alterations and omissions of 168 4 were
ignored, and a simple reprint made of the first edition of
1682.</p>

<h2>THE AUTHOR TO THE READER</h2>
<p>Courteous Reader,</p>
<p>As I was considering with my self, what I had written
concerning the Progress of the Pilgrim from this World to Glory;
and how it had been acceptable to many in this Nation: It came
again into my mind to write, as then, of him that was going to
Heaven, so now, of the Life and Death of the Ungodly, and of
their travel from this world to Hell.&nbsp; The which in this I
have done, and have put it, as thou seest, under the Name and
Title of Mr. Badman, a Name very proper for such a Subject: I
have also put it into the form of a Dialogue, that I might with
more ease to my self, and pleasure to the Reader, perform the
work.</p>
<p>And although, as I said, I have put it forth in this method,
yet have I as little as may be, gone out of the road of mine own
observation of things.&nbsp; Yea, I think I may truly say, that
to the best of my remembrance, all the things that here I
discourse of, I mean as to matter of fact, have been acted upon
the stage of this World, even many times before mine eyes.</p>
<p>Here therefore, courteous Reader, I present thee with the Life
and Death of Mr. Badman indeed: Yea, I do trace him in his Life,
from his Childhood to his Death; that thou mayest, as in a Glass,
behold with thine own eyes, the steps that take hold of Hell; and
also discern, while thou art reading of Mr. Badmans Death,
whether thou thy self art treading in his path thereto.</p>
<p>And let me entreat thee to forbear Quirking and Mocking, for
that I say Mr. Badman is dead; but rather gravely enquire
concerning thy self by the Word, whether thou art one of his
Linage or no: For Mr. Badman has left many of his Relations
behind him; yea, the very World is overspread with his
Kindred.&nbsp; True, some of his Relations, as he, are gone to
their place, and long home, but thousands of thousands are left
behind; as Brothers, Sisters, Cousens, Nephews, besides
innumerable of his Friends and Associates.</p>
<p>I may say, and yet speak nothing but too much truth in so
saying, that there is scarce a Fellowship, a Community, or
Fraternity of men in the World, but some of Mr. Badmans Relations
are there: yea rarely can we find a Family or Houshold in a Town,
where he has not left behind him either Brother, Nephew or
Friend.</p>
<p>The Butt therefore, that at this time I shoot at, is wide; and
&rsquo;twill be as impossible for this Book to go into several
Families, and not to arrest some, as for the Kings Messenger to
rush into an house full of Traitors, and find none but honest men
there.</p>
<p>I cannot but think that this shot will light upon many, since
our fields are so full of this Game; but how many it will kill to
Mr. Badmans course, and make alive to the Pilgrims Progress, that
is not in me to determine; this secret is with the Lord our God
only, and he alone knows to whom he will bless it to so good and
so blessed an end.&nbsp; However, I have put fire to the Pan, and
doubt not but the report will quickly be heard.</p>
<p>I told you before, that Mr. Badman had left many of his
Friends and Relations behind him, but if I survive them (as
that&rsquo;s a great question to me) I may also write of their
lives: However, whether my life be longer or shorter, this is my
Prayer at present, that God will stir up Witnesses against them,
that may either convert or confound them; for wherever they live,
and roll in their wickedness, they are the Pest and Plague of
that Countrey.</p>
<p>England shakes and totters already, by reason of the burden
that Mr. Badman and his Friends have wickedly laid upon it: Yea,
our Earth reels and staggereth to and fro like a Drunkard, the
transgression thereof is heavy upon it.</p>
<p>Courteous Reader, I will treat thee now, even at the Door and
Threshold of this house, but only with this Intelligence, that
Mr. Badman lies dead within.&nbsp; Be pleased therefore (if thy
leisure will serve thee) to enter in, and behold the state in
which he is laid, betwixt his Death-bed and the Grave.&nbsp; He
is not buried as yet, nor doth he stink, as is designed he shall,
before he lies down in oblivion.</p>
<p>Now as others have had their Funerals solemnized, according to
their Greatness and Grandure in the world, so likewise Mr.
Badman, (forasmuch as he deserveth not to go down to his grave
with silence) has his Funeral state according to his deserts.</p>
<p>Four things are usual at great mens Funerals, which we will
take leave, and I hope without offence, to allude to, in the
Funeral of Mr. Badman.</p>
<p>First, They are sometimes, when dead, presented to their
Friends, by their compleatly wrought Images, as lively as by
cunning mens hands they can be; that the remembrance of them may
be renewed to their survivors, the remembrance of them and their
deeds: And this I have endeavoured to answer in my discourse of
Mr. Badman; and therefore I have drawn him forth in his featours
and actions from his Childhood to his Gray hairs.&nbsp; Here
therefore thou hast him lively set forth as in Cutts; both as to
the minority, flower, and seniority of his Age, together with
those actions of his life, that he was most capable of doing, in,
and under those present circumstances of time, place, strength;
and the opportunities that did attend him in these.</p>
<p>Secondly, There is also usual at great mens Funerals, those
Badges and Scutcheons of their honour, that they have received
from their Ancestors, or have been thought worthy of for the
deeds and exploits they have done in their life: And here Mr.
Badman has his, but such as vary from all men of worth, but so
much the more agreeing with the merit of his doings: They all
have descended in state, he only as an abominable branch.&nbsp;
His deserts are the deserts of sin, and therefore the Scutcheons
of honour that he has, are only that he died without Honour, and
at his end became a fool.&nbsp; Thou shalt not be joyned with
them in burial.&mdash;The seed of evil doers shall never be
renowned.</p>
<p>The Funeral pomp therefore of Mr. Badman, is to wear upon his
Hearse the Badges of a dishonourable and wicked life; since his
bones are full of the sins of his Youth, which shall lye down, as
Job sayes, in the dust with him: nor is it fit that any should be
his Attendants, now at his death, but such as with him conspired
against their own souls in their life; persons whose
transgressions have made them infamous to all that have or shall
know what they have done.</p>
<p>Some notice therefore I have also here in this little
discourse given the Reader, of them who were his Confederates in
his life, and Attendants at his death; with a hint, either of
some high Villany committed by them, as also of those Judgments
that have overtaken and fallen upon them from the just and
revenging hand of God.&nbsp; All which are things either fully
known by me, as being eye and ear-witness thereto, or that I have
received from such hands, whose relation as to this, I am bound
to believe.&nbsp; And that the Reader may know them from other
things and passages herein contained, I have pointed at them in
the Margent, as with a finger thus: 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>Thirdly, The Funerals of persons of Quality have been
solemnized with some suitable Sermon at the time and place of
their Burial; but that I am not come to as yet, having got no
further than to Mr. Badmans death: but for as much as he must be
buried, after he hath stunk out his time before his beholders, I
doubt not but some such that we read are appointed to be at the
burial of Gog, will do this work in my stead; such as shall leave
him neither skin nor bone above ground, but shall set a sign by
it till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog,
Ezek. 39.</p>
<p>Fourthly, At Funerals there does use to be Mourning and
lamentation, but here also Mr. Badman differs from others; his
Familiars cannot lament his departure, for they have not sence of
his damnable state; they rather ring him, and sing him to Hell in
the sleep of death, in which he goes thither.&nbsp; Good men
count him no loss to the world, his place can well be without
him, his loss is only his own, and &rsquo;tis too late for him to
recover that dammage or loss by a Sea of bloody tears, could he
shed them.&nbsp; Yea, God has said, he will laugh at his
destruction, who then shall lament for him, saying, Ah! my
brother.&nbsp; He was but a stinking Weed in his life; nor was he
better at all in his death: such may well be thrown over the wall
without sorrow, when once God has plucked them up by the roots in
his wrath.</p>
<p>Reader, If thou art of the race, linage, stock or fraternity
of Mr. Badman, I tell thee before thou readest this Book, thou
wilt neither brook the Author nor it, because he hath writ of Mr.
Badman as he has.&nbsp; For he that condemneth the wicked that
die so, passeth also the sentence upon the wicked that
live.&nbsp; I therefore expect neither credit of, nor countenance
from thee, for this Narration of thy kinsmans life.</p>
<p>For thy old love to thy Friend, his wayes, doings, &amp;c.
will stir up in thee enmity rather, in thy very heart, against
me.&nbsp; I shall therefore incline to think of thee, that thou
wilt rent, burn, or throw it away in contempt: yea and wish also,
that for writing so notorious a truth, some mischief may befall
me.&nbsp; I look also to be loaded by thee with disdain, scorn
and contempt; yea that thou shouldest railingly and vilifyingly
say, I lye, and am a bespatterer of honest mens lives and
deaths.&nbsp; For Mr. Badman, when himself was alive, could not
abide to be counted a Knave (though his actions told all that
went by, that indeed he was such an one:) How then should his
brethren, that survive him, and that tread in his very steps,
approve of the sentence that by this Book is pronounced against
him?&nbsp; Will they not rather imitate Corah, Dathan, and
Abiram&rsquo;s friends, even rail at me for condemning him, as
they did at Moses for doing execution?</p>
<p>I know &rsquo;tis ill pudling in the Cockatrices den, and that
they run hazards that hunt the Wild-Boar.&nbsp; The man also that
writeth Mr. Badmans life, had need to be fenced with a Coat of
Mail, and with the Staffe of a Spear, for that his surviving
friends will know what he doth: but I have adventured to do it,
and to play, at this time, at the hole of these Asps; if they
bite, they bite; if they sting, they sting.&nbsp; Christ sends
his Lambs in the midst of Wolves, not to do like them, but to
suffer by them for bearing plain testimony against their bad
deeds: But had one not need to walk with a Guard, and to have a
Sentinel stand at ones door for this?&nbsp; Verily, the flesh
would be glad of such help; yea, a spiritual man, could he tell
how to get it.&nbsp; Acts 23.&nbsp; But I am stript naked of
these, and yet am commanded to be faithful in my servi[c]e for
Christ.&nbsp; Well then, I have spoken what I have spoken, and
now come on me what will, Job 13. 13.&nbsp; True, the Text sayes,
Rebuke a scorner, and he will hate thee; and that, He that
reproveth a wicked man, getteth himself a Blot and Shame; but
what then?&nbsp; Open rebuke is better than secret love; and he
that receives it, shall find it so afterwards.</p>
<p>So then, whether Mr. Badmans friends shall rage or laugh at
what I have writ, I know that the better end of the staffe is
mine.&nbsp; My endeavour is to stop an hellish Course of Life,
and to save a soul from death, (Jam. 5.) and if for so doing, I
meet with envy from them, from whom in reason I should have
thanks, I must remember the man in the dream, that cut his way
through his armed enemies, and so got into the beauteous Palace;
I must, I say, remember him, and do my self likewise.</p>
<p>Yet four things I will propound to the consideration of Mr.
Badmans friends, before I turn my back upon them.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Suppose that there be an Hell in very deed, not that
I do question it, any more than I do whether there be a Sun to
shine; but I suppose it for argument sake, with Mr. Badmans
friends; I say, suppose there be an Hell, and that too, such an
one as the Scripture speaks of, one at the remotest distance from
God and Life eternall, one where the Worm of a guilty Conscience
never dyes, and where the fire of the Wrath of God is not
quenched.</p>
<p>Suppose, I say, that there is such an Hell, prepared of God
(as there is indeed) for the body and soul of the ungodly World
after this life, to be tormented in: I say, do but with thy self
suppose it, and then tell me, Is it not prepared for thee, thou
being a wicked man?&nbsp; Let thy conscience speak, I say, is it
not prepared for thee, thou being an ungodly man?&nbsp; And dost
thou think, wast thou there now, that thou art able to wrestle
with the Judgment of God?&nbsp; Why then do the fallen Angers
tremble there? thy hands cannot be strong, nor can thy heart
endure, in that day when God shall deal with thee: Ezek. 22.
14.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Suppose that some one that is now a soul in Hell for
sin, was permitted to come hither again to dwell; and that they
had a grant also, that upon amendment of life, next time the dye,
to change that place for Heaven ant Glory; what sayest thou, O
wicked man? would such an one (thinkest thou) run again into the
same course of life as before, and venture the damnation that for
sin he had already been in?&nbsp; Would he choose again to lead
that cursed life that afresh would kindle the flames of Hell upon
him, and that would bind him up under the heavy wrath of
God?&nbsp; O! he would not, he would not; the sixteenth of Luke
insinuates it: yea Reason it self, awake, would abhorr it, and
tremble at such a thought.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Suppose again, that thou that livest and rollest in
thy sin, and that as yet hast known nothing but the pleasure
thereof, shouldst be by an angel conveyed to some place where
with convenience, from thence thou mightest have a view of Heaven
and Hell; of the Joyes of the one, and the torments of the other;
I say, suppose that from thence thou mightest have such a view
thereof, as would convince thy reason, that both Heaven and Hell,
are such realities as by the Word they are declared to be;
wouldest thou (thinkest thou) when brought to thy home again,
chuse to thy self thy former life, to wit, to return to thy folly
again?&nbsp; No; if belief of what thou sawest, remained with
thee, thou wouldest eat Fire and Brimstone first.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I will propound again.&nbsp; Suppose that there was
amongst us such a Law, (and such a Magistrate to inflict the
penalty,) That for every open wickedness committed by thee, so
much of thy flesh should with burning Pincers be plucked from thy
Bones: Wouldest thou then go on in thy open way of Lying,
Swearing, Drinking and Whoring, as thou with delight doest
now?&nbsp; Surely, surely, No: The fear of the punishment would
make thee forbear; yea, would make thee tremble, even then when
thy lusts were powerfull, to think what a punishment thou wast
sure to sustain, so soon as the pleasure was over.&nbsp; But Oh!
the folly, the madness, the desperate madness that is in the
hearts of Mr. Badmans friends, who in despite of the threatnings
of an holy and sin revenging God, and of the outcries and
warnings of all good men; yea, that will in despite of the groans
and torments of those that are now in Hell for sin, (Luk. 16. 24.
28.) go on in a sinfull course of life; yea, though every sin is
also a step of descent, down to that infernal Cave.&nbsp; O how
true is that saying of Solomon, The heart of the sons of men is
full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and
after that they go to the dead, Eccles. 9. 3.&nbsp; To the dead!
that is, to the dead in Hell, to the damned dead; the place to
which those that have dyed Bad men are gone, and that those that
live Bad men are like to go to, when a little more sin, like
stollen waters, hath been imbibed by their sinful souls.</p>
<p>That which has made me publish this Book is,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; For that wickedness like a flood is like to drown our
English world: it begins already to be above the tops of
mountains; it has almost swallowed up all; our Youth, our Middle
age, Old age, and all, are almost carried away of this
flood.&nbsp; O Debauchery, Debauchery, what hast thou done in
England!&nbsp; Thou hast corrupted our Young men, and hast made
our Old men beasts; thou hast deflowered our Virgins, and hast
made Matrons Bawds.&nbsp; Thou hast made our earth to reel to and
fro like a drunkard; &rsquo;tis in danger to be removed like a
Cottage, yea, it is, because transgression is so heavy upon it,
like to fall and rise no more.&nbsp; Isa. 24. 20.</p>
<p>O! that I could mourn for England, and for the sins that are
committed therein, even while I see that without repentance, the
men of Gods wrath are about to deal with us, each having his
slaughtering weapon in his hand: (Ezek. 9. 1, 2.)&nbsp; Well, I
have written, and by Gods assistance shall pray, that this flood
may abate in England: and could I but see the tops of the
Mountains above it, I should think that these waters were
abating.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It is the duty of those that can, to cry out against
this deadly plague, yea, to lift up their voice as with a Trumpet
against it; that men may he awakened about it, flye from it, as
from that which is the greatest of evils.&nbsp; Sin pull&rsquo;d
Angels out of Heaven, pulls men down to Hell, and overthroweth
Kingdoms.&nbsp; Who, that sees an house on fire, will not give
the Allarum to them that dwell therein? who that sees the Land
invaded, will not set the Beacons on a fame?&nbsp; Who, that sees
the Devils, as roaring Lyons, continually devouring souls, will
not make an Out-cry?&nbsp; But above all, when we see sin, sinful
sin, a swallowing up a Nation, sinking of a Nation, and bringing
its Inhabitants to temporal, spiritual, and eternal ruine, shall
we not cry out, and cry, They are drunk, but not with Wine; they
stagger, but not with strong drink; they are intoxicated with the
deadly poyson of sin, which will, if its malignity be not by
wholsom means allayed, bring Soul and Body, and Estate and
Countrey, and all, to ruin and destruction?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In and by this my Out-cry, I shall deliver my self
from the ruins of them that perish: for a man can do no more in
this matter, I mean a man in my capacity, than to detect and
condemn the wickedness, warn the evil doer of the Judgment, and
fly therefrom my self.&nbsp; But Oh! that I might not only
deliver my self!&nbsp; Oh that many would hear, and turn at this
my cry, from sin! that they may be secured from the death and
Judgment that attend it.</p>
<p>Why I have handled the matter in this method, is best known to
my self: and why I have concealed most of the Names of the
persons whose sins or punishments I here and there in this Book
make relation of, is,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; For that neither the sins nor Judgments were all
alike open; the sins of some, were committed, and the Judgments
executed for them only in a corner.&nbsp; Not to say that I could
not learn some of their names; for could I, I should not have
made them publick, for this reason.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Because I would not provoke those of their Relations
that survive them; I would not justly provoke them, and yet, as I
think, I should, should I have intailed their punishment to their
sins, and both to their names, and so have turned them into the
world.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Nor would I lay them under disgrace and contempt,
which would, as I think, unavoidably have happened unto them had
I withall inserted their Names.</p>
<p>As for those whose Names I mention, their crimes or Judgments
were manifest; publick almost as any thing of that nature that
happeneth to mortal men.&nbsp; Such therefore have published
their own shame by their sin, and God, his anger, by taking of
open vengeance.</p>
<p>As Job sayes, God has strook them as wicked men in the open
sight of others, Job 34. 26.&nbsp; So that I cannot conceive,
since their sin and Judgment was so conspicuous, that my
admonishing the world thereof, should turn to their detriment:
For the publishing of these things, are, so far as Relation is
concerned, intended for remembrancers: That they may also bethink
themselves, repent and turn to God, lest the Judgments for their
sins should prove hereditary.&nbsp; For the God of Heaven hath
threatned to visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,
if they hate him, to the third and fourth generation, Exod. 20.
5.</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzars punishment for his pride being open, (for he
was for his sin, driven from his Kingly dignity, and from among
men too, to eat grass like an Ox, and to company with the
beasts,) Daniel did not stick to tell Belshazzar his son to his
face thereof; nor to publish it that it might be read and
remembred by the generations to come.&nbsp; The same may be said
of Judas and Ananias, &amp;c. for their sin and punishment were
known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem, Acts 1. Chap. 5.</p>
<p>Nor is it a sign but of desperate impenitence and hardness of
heart, when the offspring or relations of those who have fallen
by open, fearfull and prodigious Judgments, for their sin, shall
overlook, forget, pass by, or take no notice of such high
outgoings of God against them and their house.&nbsp; Thus Daniel
aggravates Belshazzars crime, for that he hardened his heart in
pride, though he knew that for that very sin and transgression
his father was brought down from his height, and made to be a
companion for Asses.&nbsp; And thou his son, O Belshazzar, sayes
he, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all
this.&nbsp; Dan. 5.&nbsp; A home reproof indeed, but home is most
fit for an open and continued-in transgression.</p>
<p>Let those then that are the Offspring or relations of such,
who by their own sin, and the dreadfull Judgments of God, are
made to become a sign, (Deut. 16. 9, 10.) having been swept, as
dung, from off the face of the earth, beware, lest when Judgment
knocks at their door, for their sins, as it did before at the
door of their Pregenitors, it falls also with as heavy a stroak
as on them that went before them: Lest, I say, they in that day,
instead of finding mercy, find for their high, daring, and
Judgment-affronting-sins, Judgment without mercy.</p>
<p>To conclude, let those that would not dye Mr. Badmans death,
take heed of Mr. Badmans wayes: for his wayes bring to his end;
Wickedness will not deliver him that is given to it; though they
should cloak all with a Profession of Religion.</p>
<p>If it was a transgression of Old, for a man to wear a Womans
Apparel, surely it is a transgression now for a sinner to wear a
Christian Profession for a Cloak.&nbsp; Wolves in Sheeps
Cloathing swarm in England this day: Wolves both as to Doctrine,
and as to Practice too.&nbsp; Some men make a Profession, I
doubt, on purpose that they may twist themselves into a Trade;
and thence into an Estate; yea, and if need be, into an Estate
Knavishly, by the ruins of their Neighbour: let such take heed,
for those that do such things have the greater damnation.</p>
<p>Christian, make thy Profession shine by a Conversation
according to the Gospel: Or else thou wilt damnifie Religion,
bring scandal to thy Brethren, and give offence to the Enemies;
and &rsquo;twould be better that a Millstone was hanged about thy
neck, and that thou, as so adorned, wast cast into the bottom of
the Sea, than so to do.</p>
<p>Christian, a Profession according to the Gospel, is, in these
dayes, a rare thing; seek then after it, put it on, and keep it
without spot; and (as becomes thee) white, and clean, and thou
shalt be a rare Christian.</p>
<p>The Prophecy of the last times is, that professing men (for so
I understand the Text) s[h]all be, many of them, base; (2 Tim.
3.) but continue thou in the things that thou hast learned, not
of wanton men, not of licentious times, but of the Word and
Doctrine of God, that is according to Godliness; and thou shalt
walk with Christ in white.</p>
<p>Now God Almighty give his people Grace, not to hate or malign
Sinners nor yet to choose any of their wayes, but to keep
themselves pure from the blood of all men, by speaking and doing
according to that Name and those Rules that they profess to know,
and love; for Jesus Christs sake.</p>

<h2>THE LIFE AND DEATH OF MR. BADMAN</h2>
<p>Presented to the World in a Familiar DIALOGUE Betwixt Mr.
<i>WISEMAN</i>, And, Mr. <i>ATTENTIVE</i>.</p>
<p><i>Wiseman</i>.</p>
<p>Good morrow my good Neighbour, Mr. Attentive; whither are you
walking so early this morning? methinks you look as if you were
concerned about something more than ordinary.&nbsp; Have you lost
any of your Cattel, or what is the matter?</p>
<p>Attentive.&nbsp; Good Sir, Good morrow to you, I have not as
yet lost ought, but yet you give a right ghess of me, for I am,
as you say, concerned in my heart, but &rsquo;tis because of the
badness of the times.&nbsp; And Sir, you, as all our Neighbours
know, are a very observing man, pray therefore what do you think
of them?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I think, as you say, to wit, that they
are bad times, and bad they will be, untill men are better: for
they are bad men that make bad times; if men therefore would
mend, so would the times.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a folly to look for
good dayes, so long as sin is so high, and those that study its
nourishment so many.&nbsp; God bring it down, and those that
nourish it to Repentance, and then my good Neighbour, you will be
concerned, not as you are now: Now you are concerned because
times are so bad; but then you will be so, &rsquo;cause times are
so good: Now you are concerned so as to be perplexed, but then
you will be concerned so as to lift up your voice with shouting;
for I dare say, could you see such dayes they would make you
shout.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Ai, so they would, such times I have prayed for,
such times I have longed for: but I fear they&rsquo;l be worse
before they be better.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Make no Conclusions, man: for he that hath the
hearts of men in his hand, can change them from worse to better,
and so bad times into good.&nbsp; God give long life to them that
are good, and especially to those of them that are capable of
doing him service in the world.&nbsp; The Ornament and Beauty of
this lower World, next to God and his Wonders, are the men that
spangle and shine in godliness.</p>
<p>Now as Mr. Wiseman said this, he gave a great sigh.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; But why, good Sir, do you
sigh so deeply? is it for ought else than that for the which as
you have perceived, I my self am concerned?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I am concerned with you, for the badness of the
times; but that was not the cause of that sigh, of the which, as
I see, you take notice.&nbsp; I sighed at the remembrance of the
death of that man for whom the Bell tolled at our Town
yesterday.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I trow, Mr. Goodman your Neighbour is
not dead.&nbsp; Indeed I did hear that he had been sick.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; No, no, it is not he.&nbsp; Had it been he, I
could not but have been concerned, but yet not as I am concerned
now.&nbsp; If he had died, I should only have been concerned for
that the world had lost a Light: but the man that I am concerned
for now, was one that never was good, therefore such an one who
is not dead only, but damned.&nbsp; He died that he might die, he
went from Life to Death, and then from Death to Death, from Death
Natural to death Eternal.&nbsp; And as he spake this, the water
stood in his eyes.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Indeed, to goe from a death-bed to Hell is a
fearful thing to think on.&nbsp; But good Neighbour Wiseman, be
pleased to tell me who this man was, and why you conclude him so
miserable in his death?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Well, if you can stay, I will tell you who he was,
and why I conclude thus concerning him.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; My leisure will admit me to stay, and I am
willing to hear you out.&nbsp; And I pray God your discourse may
take hold on my heart, that I may be bettered thereby.&nbsp; So
they agreed to sit down under a tree: Then Mr. Wiseman proceeded
as followeth.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; The man that I mean, is one Mr. Badman; he has
lived in our Town a great while, and now, as I said, he is
dead.&nbsp; But the reason of my being so concerned at his death,
is, not for that he was at all related to me, or for that any
good conditions died with him, for he was far from them, but for
that, as I greatly fear, he hath, as was hinted before, died two
deaths at once.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I perceive what you mean by two deaths at once;
and to speak truth, &rsquo;tis a fearfull thing thus to have
ground to think of any: for although the death of the ungodly and
sinners is laid to heart but of few, yet to die in such a state,
is more dreadful and fearful than any man can imagine.&nbsp;
Indeed if a man had no Soul, if his state was not truely
Immortal, the matter would not be so much; but for a man to be so
disposed of by his Maker, as to be appointed a sensible being for
ever, and for him too to fall into the hands of revenging
Justice, that will be always, to the utmost extremity that his
sin deserveth, punishing of him in the dismal dungeon of Hell,
this must needs be unutterably sad, and lamentable.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; There is no man, I think, that is sensible of the
worth of one Soul, but must, when he hears of the death of
unconverted men, be stricken with sorrow and grief: because, as
you said well, that mans state is such, that he has a sensible
being for ever.&nbsp; For &rsquo;tis sense that makes punishment
heavy.&nbsp; But yet sense is not all that the Damned have, they
have sense and reason too; so then, as Sense receiveth punishment
with sorrow because it feels, and bleeds under the same, so by
Reason, and the exercise thereof, in the midst of torment, all
present Affliction is aggravated, and that three manner of
wayes:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Reason will consider thus with himself; For what am I
thus tormented? and will easily find &rsquo;tis for nothing but
that base and filthy thing, Sin; and now will Vexation be mixed
with Punishment, and that will greatly heighten the
Affliction.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Reason will consider thus with himself.&nbsp; How
long must this be my state?&nbsp; And will soon return to himself
this Answer: This must be my state for ever and ever.&nbsp; Now
this will greatly increase the torment.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Reason will consider thus with himself; What have I
lost more than present ease and quiet by my sins that I have
committed?&nbsp; And will quickly return himself this answer: I
have lost Communion with God, Christ, Saints and Angels, and a
share in Heaven and eternal Life: And this also must needs
greaten the misery of poor damned souls.&nbsp; And this is the
case of Mr. Badman.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I feel my heart even shake at the thoughts of
coming into such a state.&nbsp; Hell! who knows that is yet
alive, what the torments of Hell are?&nbsp; This word Hell gives
a very dreadful sound.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Ai, so it does in the ears of him that has a
tender Conscience.&nbsp; But if, as you say, and that truly, the
very Name of Hell, is so dreadful, what is the Place it self, and
what are the Punishments that are there inflicted, and that
without the least intermission, upon the Souls of damned men, for
ever and ever.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but passing this; my leisure will admit me
to stay, and therefore pray tell me what it is that makes you
think that Mr. Badman is gone to Hell.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I will tell you.&nbsp; But first do you know which
of the Badmans I mean?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Why was there more of them than one?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; O, yes, a great many, both Brothers and Sisters,
and yet all of them the Children of a godly Parent, the more a
great deal is the pity.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Which of them therefore was it that died.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; The eldest, old in years, and old in sin; but the
sinner that dies an hundred years old shall be accursed.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but what makes you think he is gone to
Hell?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; His wicked life, and fearful death, specially
since the Manner of his death was so corresponding with his
life.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray let me know the manner of his death, if your
self did perfectly know it.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I was there when he died: But I desire not to see
another such man (while I live) die in such sort as he did.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray therefore let me hear it.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You say you have leisure and can stay, and
therefore, if you please, we will discourse even orderly of
him.&nbsp; First, we will begin with his Life, and then proceed
to his Death: Because a relation of the first may the more affect
you, when you shall hear of the second.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Did you then so well know his Life?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I knew him of a Child.&nbsp; I was a man, when he
was but a boy, and I made special observation of him from first
to last.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray then let me hear from you an account of his
Life; but be as brief as you can, for I long to hear of the
manner of his death.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I will endeavour to answer your desires, and
first, I will tell you, that from a Child he was very bad: his
very beginning was ominous, and presaged that no good end, was,
in likelyhood, to follow thereupon.&nbsp; There were several sins
that he was given to, when but a little one, that manifested him
to be notoriously infected with Or[i]ginal corruption; for I dare
say he learned none of them of his Father or Mother; nor was he
admitted to go much abroad among other Children, that were vile,
to learn to sin of them: Nay, contrariwise, if at any time he did
get abroad amongst others, he would be as the Inventer of bad
words, and an example in bad actions.&nbsp; To them all he used
to be, as we say, the Ring-leader, and Master-sinner from a
Childe.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This was a bad Beginning indeed, and did
demonstrate that he was, as you say, polluted, very much polluted
with Original Corruption.&nbsp; For to speak my mind freely, I do
confess, that it is mine opinion, that Children come polluted
with sin into the World, and that oft-times the sins of their
youth, especially while they are very young, are rather by vertue
of Indwelling sin, than by examples that are set before them by
others.&nbsp; Not but that they learn to sin by example too, but
Example is not the root, but rather the Temptation unto
wickedness.&nbsp; The root is sin within; for from within, out of
the heart of man proceedeth sin. <a name="citation20a"></a><a
href="#footnote20a" class="citation">[20a]</a> <a
name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b"
class="citation">[20b]</a></p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I am glad to hear that you are of this opinion,
and to confirm what you have said by a few hints from the
Word.&nbsp; Man in his birth is compared to an Ass, (an unclean
Beast) and to a wretched Infant in its blood: besides, all the
first-born of old that were offered unto the Lord, were to be
redeemed at the age of a month, and that was before they were
sinners by imitation.&nbsp; The Scripture also affirmeth, <a
name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a> that by the sin of one, Judgement came
upon all; and renders this reason, for that all have sinned: nor
is that Objection worth a rush, That Christ by his death hath
taken away Original Sin.&nbsp; First, Because it is
Scriptureless.&nbsp; Secondly, Because it makes them incapable of
Salvation by Christ; for none but those that in their own Persons
are sinners, are to have Salvation by him.&nbsp; Many other
things might be added, but between persons so well agreed as you
and I are, these may suffice at present: but when an Antagonist
comes to deal with us about this matter, then we have for him
often other strong Arguments, if he be an Antagonist worth the
taking notice of. <a name="citation21b"></a><a
href="#footnote21b" class="citation">[21b]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But, as was hinted before, he used to be the
Ring-leading Sinner, or the Master of mischief among other
children; yet these are but Generals; pray therefore tell me in
Particular which were the sins of his Childhood.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I will so.&nbsp; When he was but a Child, he was
so addicted to Lying, <a name="citation21c"></a><a
href="#footnote21c" class="citation">[21c]</a> that his Parents
scarce knew when to believe he spake true; yea, he would invent,
tell, and stand to the Lyes that he invented and told, and that
with such an audacious face, that one might even read in his very
countenance the symptoms of an hard and desperate heart this
way.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This was an ill beginning indeed, and argueth
that he began to harden himself in sin betimes.&nbsp; For a lye
cannot be knowingly told and stood in, (and I perceive that this
was his manner of way in Lying) but he must as it were force his
own heart into it.&nbsp; Yea, he must make his heart <a
name="citation21d"></a><a href="#footnote21d"
class="citation">[21d]</a> hard, and bold to doe it: Yea, he must
be arrived to an exceeding pitch of wickedness thus to doe, since
all this he did against that good education, that before you
seemed to hint, he had from his Father and Mother.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; The want of good Education, as you have intimated,
is many times a cause why Children doe so easily, so soon, become
bad; especially when there is not only a want of that, but bad
Examples enough, as, the more is the pity, there is in many
Families; by vertue of which poor Children are trained up in Sin,
and nursed therein for the Devil and Hell.&nbsp; But it was
otherwise with Mr. Badman, for to my knowledge, this his way of
Lying, was a great grief to his Parents, for their hearts were
much dejected at this beginning of their Son; nor did there want
Counsel and Correction from them to him, if that would have made
him better.&nbsp; He wanted not to be told, in my hearing, and
that over and over and over, That all Lyars should have their
part in the Lake that burns with fire and brimstone; and that
whosoever loveth and maketh a lye, should not have any part in
the new and heavenly Jerusalem: <a name="citation22a"></a><a
href="#footnote22a" class="citation">[22a]</a>&nbsp; But all
availed nothing with him; when a fit, or an occasion to lie, came
upon him, he would invent, tell, and stand to his Lie (as
steadfastly as if it had been the biggest of truths,) that he
told, and that with that hardening of his heart and face, that it
would be to those that stood by, a wonder.&nbsp; Nay, and this he
would doe when under the rod of correction which is appointed by
God for Parents to use, that thereby they might keep their
Children from Hell. <a name="citation22b"></a><a
href="#footnote22b" class="citation">[22b]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Truly it was, as I said, a bad beginning, he
served the Devil betimes; yea he became a Nurse to one of his <a
name="citation22c"></a><a href="#footnote22c"
class="citation">[22c]</a> Brats, for a spirit of Lying is the
Devils Brat, <a name="citation22d"></a><a href="#footnote22d"
class="citation">[22d]</a> for he is a Liar and the Father of
it.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Right, he is the Father of it indeed.&nbsp; A Lie
is begot by the Devil, as the Father, and is brought forth by the
wicked heart, as the Mother: wherefore another Scripture also
saith, Why hath Satan filled thy heart to lye, <a
name="citation22e"></a><a href="#footnote22e"
class="citation">[22e]</a> &amp;c.&nbsp; Yea, he calleth the
heart that is big with a lye, an heart that hath Conceived, that
is, by the Devil.&nbsp; Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy
heart, thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.&nbsp; True, his
lye was a lye of the highest nature, but every lye hath the <a
name="citation22f"></a><a href="#footnote22f"
class="citation">[22f]</a> same Father and Mother as had the lie
last spoken of.&nbsp; For he is a lier, and the Father of
it.&nbsp; A lie then is the Brat of Hell, and it cannot <a
name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a> be in the heart before the person has
committed a kind of spiritual Adultery with the Devil.&nbsp; That
Soul therefore that telleth a known lie, has lien with, and
conceived it by lying with the Devil, the only Father of
lies.&nbsp; For a lie has only one Father and Mother, the Devil
and the Heart.&nbsp; No marvel therefore if the hearts that hatch
and bring forth Lies, be so much of complexion with the
Devil.&nbsp; Yea, no marvel though God and Christ have so bent
their Word against lyers: a lyer is weded to the Devil
himself.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; It seems a marvellous thing in mine eyes, that
since a lye is the Offspring of the devill, and since a lye
brings the soul to the very den of Devils, to wit, the dark
dungeon of hell; that men should be so desperately wicked as to
accustom themselves to so horrible a thing.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It seems also marvellous to me, specially when I
observe for how little a matter some men will study, contrive,
make and tell a lye.&nbsp; You shall have some that will lye it
over and over, and that for a peny <a name="citation23b"></a><a
href="#footnote23b" class="citation">[23b]</a> profit.&nbsp; Yea,
lye and stand in it, although they know that they lye: yea, you
shall have some men that will not stick to tell lye after lye,
though themselves get nothing thereby; They will tell lyes in
their ordinary discourse with their Neighbours, also their News,
their Jests, and their Tales must needs be adorned with lyes; or
else they seem to bear no good sound to the ear, nor shew much to
the fancie of him to whom they are told.&nbsp; But alas, what
will these lyers doe, when, for their lyes they shall be tumbled
down into hell, to that Devil that did beget those lyes in their
heart, and so be tormented by fire and brimstone, with him, and
that for ever and ever, for their lyes?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Can you not give one some example of Gods
Judgements upon lyers, that one may tell them to lyers when one
hears them lye, if perhaps they may by the hearing thereof, be
made afraid, and ashamed to lye.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Examples! why, <a name="citation23c"></a><a
href="#footnote23c" class="citation">[23c]</a> Saphira and his
wife are examples enough to put a stop, one would think, to a
spirit addicted thereto, for they both were stricken down dead
for telling a lye, and that by God himself, in the midst of a
company of people.&nbsp; But if Gods threatning of Liers with
Hell-fire, and with the loss of the Kingdom of Heaven, will not
prevail with them to leave off to lie and make lies, it cannot be
imagined that a relation of temporal Judgements that have swept
liers out of the World heretofore, should do it.&nbsp; Now, as I
said, this Lying was one of the first sins that Mr. Badman was
addicted to, and he could make them and tell them fearfully.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I am sorry to hear this of him, and so much the
more because, as I fear, this sin did not reign in him <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a> alone; for usually one that is
accustomed to lying, is also accustomed to other evils besides,
and if it were not so also with Mr. Badman, it would be indeed a
wonder.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You say true, the lier is a Captive slave of more
than the spirit of lying: and therefore this Mr. Badman, as he
was a lier from a Child, so he was also much given to <a
name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b"
class="citation">[24b]</a> pilfer and steal, so that what he
could, as we say, handsomly lay his hands on, that was counted
his own, whether they were the things of his fellow Children; or
if he could lay hold of any thing at a Neighbours house, he would
take it away; you must understand me of Trifles; for being let
but a Child he attempted no great matter, especially at
first.&nbsp; But yet as he grew up in strength and ripeness of
wit, so he attempted to pilfer and steal things still of more
value than at first.&nbsp; He took at last great pleasure in
robbing of Gardens and Orchards; and as he grew up, to steal
Pullen from the Neighbourhood: Yea, what was his <a
name="citation24c"></a><a href="#footnote24c"
class="citation">[24c]</a> Fathers, could not escape his fingers,
all was Fish that came to his Net, so hardened, at last, was he
in this mischief also.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; You make me wonder more and more.&nbsp; What,
play the Thief too!&nbsp; What play the Thief so soon!&nbsp; He
could not but know, though he was but a Child, that what he took
from others, was none of his own.&nbsp; Besides, if his Father
was a good man, as you say, it could not be, but he must also
hear from him, that to steal was to transgress the Law of God,
and so to run the hazard of eternal Damnation.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; His Father was not wanting to use the means to
reclaim him, often urging, as I have been told, that saying in
the Law of Moses, <a name="citation24d"></a><a
href="#footnote24d" class="citation">[24d]</a> Thou shalt not
steal: And also that, This is the Curse that goeth forth over the
face of the whole earth, for every one that stealeth shall be cut
off, &amp;c. <a name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a"
class="citation">[25a]</a>&nbsp; The light of Nature also, though
he was little, must needs shew him that what he took from others,
was not his own, and that he would not willingly have been served
so himself.&nbsp; But all was to no purpose, let Father and
Conscience say what they would to him, he would go on, he was
resolved to go on in his wickedness.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But his Father would, as you intimate, sometimes
rebuke him for his wickedness; pray how would he carry it
then?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; How! why, like to a Thief that is found.&nbsp; He
would stand <a name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a> gloating, and hanging down his head in
a sullen, pouching manner, (a body might read, as we use to say,
the picture of Ill-luck in his face,) and when his Father did
demand his answer to such questions concerning his Villany, he
would grumble and mutter at him, and that should be all he could
get.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But you said that he would also rob his Father,
methinks that was an unnatural thing.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Natural or unnatural, all is one to a Thief.&nbsp;
Beside, you must think that he had likewise Companions to whom he
was, for the wickedness that he saw in them, more <a
name="citation25c"></a><a href="#footnote25c"
class="citation">[25c]</a> firmly knit, than either to Father or
Mother.&nbsp; Yea, and what had he cared if Father and Mother had
died for grief for him.&nbsp; Their death would have been, as he
would have counted, great release and liberty to him: For the
truth is, they and their counsel was his Bondage; yea, and if I
forget not, I have heard some say, that when he was, at times,
among his Companions, he would greatly <a
name="citation25d"></a><a href="#footnote25d"
class="citation">[25d]</a> rejoyce to think that his Parents were
old, and could not live long, and then, quoth he, I shall be mine
own man, to do what I list without their controul.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Then it seems he counted that robbing of his
Parents was no crime.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; None at all, and therefore he fell directly under
that Sentence, Whoso robbeth his Father or his Mother, and saith
it is no transgression, the same is the companion of a
destroyer.&nbsp; And for that he set so light by them as to their
Persons and Counsels, &rsquo;twas a sign that at present he was
of a very abominable spirit, <a name="citation26a"></a><a
href="#footnote26a" class="citation">[26a]</a> and that some
Judgement waited to take hold of him in time to come.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But can you imagin what it was, I mean, in his
conceit (for I speak not now of the suggestions of Satan, by
which doubtless he was put on to do these things,) I say what it
should be in his conceit, that should make him think that this
his manner of pilfering and stealing was no great matter.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It was, for that, the things that he stole, were
small; to rob Orchards, and Gardens, and to steal Pullen, and the
like, these he counted <a name="citation26b"></a><a
href="#footnote26b" class="citation">[26b]</a> Tricks of Youth,
nor would he be beat out of it by all that his Friends could
say.&nbsp; They would tell him that he must not covet, or desire,
(and yet to desire, is less than to take) even any thing, the
least thing that was his Neighbours, and that if he did, it would
be a transgression of the Law; but all was one to him: what
through the wicked Talk of his Companions, and the delusion of
his own corrupt heart, he would go on in his pilfering course,
and where he thought himself secure, would talk of, and laugh at
it when he had done.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=

</a>Atten.&nbsp; Well, I heard a man once, when he was upon the
Ladder with the Rope about his Neck, confess (when ready to be
turned off by the Hangman) that that which had brought him to
that end, was his accustoming of himself, when young, to pilfer
and steal small things.&nbsp; To my best remembrance he told us,
that he began the trade of a Thief by stealing Pins and Points,
and therefore did forewarn all the Youth, that then were gathered
together to see him die, to take heed of beginning, though but
with little sins, because by tampering at first with little ones,
way is made for the commission of bigger.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Since you are entred upon Storyes, I also will
tell you one, the which, <a name="citation26d"></a><a
href="#footnote26d" class="citation">[26d]</a> though I heard it
not with mine own Ears, yet my Author I dare believe: <a
name="citation26e"></a><a href="#footnote26e"
class="citation">[26e]</a> It is concerning one old Tod, that was
hanged about Twenty years agoe, or more, at Hartford, for being a
Thief.&nbsp; The Story is this:</p>
<p>
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>At a Summer Assizes holden at Hartfor[d], while the Judge was
sitting upon the Bench, comes this old Tod into the Court,
cloathed in a green Suit, with his Leathern Girdle in his hand,
his Bosom open, and all on a dung sweat, as if he had run for his
Life; and being come in, he spake aloud as follows: <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> My Lord, said he, Here is the veryest
Rogue that breaths upon the face of the earth.&nbsp; I have been
a Thief from a Child: When I was but a little one, I gave my self
to rob Orchards, and to do other such like wicked things, and I
have continued a Thief ever since.&nbsp; My Lord, there has not
been a Robbery committed thus many years within so many miles if
this place, but I have either been at it, or privy to it.</p>
<p>The Judge thought the fellow was mad, but after some
conference with some of the Justices, they agreed to Indict him;
and so they did of several felonious Actions; to all which he
heartily confessed Guilty, and so was hanged with his Wife at the
same time.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This is a remarkable Story indeed, and you think
it is a true one.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It is not only remarkable, but pat to our
purpose.&nbsp; This Thief, like Mr. Badman, began his Trade
betimes; he began too where Mr. Badman began, even at robbing of
Orchards, and other such things, which brought him, as you may
perceive, from sin to sin, till at last it brought him to the
publick shame of sin, which is the Gallows.</p>
<p>As for the truth of this Story, the Relator told me that he
was at the same time himself in the Court, and stood within less
than two yards of old Tod, when he heard him aloud to utter the
words.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; These two sins of lying and stealing were a bad
sign of an evil end.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; So they were, and yet Mr. Badman came not to his
end like old Tod; Though I fear, to as bad, nay, worse than was
that death of the Gallows, though less discerned by spectators;
but more of that by and by.&nbsp; But you talk of these two sins
as if these were all that Mr. Badman was addicted to in his
Youth: Alas, alas, he swarmed with sins, even as a Begger does
with Vermin, and that when he was but a Boy.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Why what other sins was he addicted to, I mean
while he was but a Child?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You need not ask, to what other sins was he, but
to what other sins was he not addicted, that is, of such as
suited with his Age: for a man may safely say, that nothing that
was vile came amiss to him; if he was but capable to do it.&nbsp;
Indeed some sins there be that Childhood knows not how to be
tampering with; but I speak of sins that he was capable of
committing, of which I will nominate two or three more.&nbsp;
And,</p>
<p>First, He could not endure the <a name="citation28a"></a><a
href="#footnote28a" class="citation">[28a]</a> Lords Day, because
of the Holiness that did attend it; the beginning of that Day was
to him as if he was going to Prison, (except he could get out
from his Father and Mother, and lurk in by-holes among his
Companions, untill holy Duties were over.)&nbsp; Reading the
Scriptures, hearing Sermons, godly Conference, repeating of
Sermons, and Prayer, were things that he could not away with; and
therefore if his Father on such days, (as often he did, though
sometimes notwithstanding his diligence, he would be sure to give
him the slip) did keep him strictly to the observation of the
day, he would plainly shew by all carriages that he was highly
discontent therewith: he would sleep at Duties, would talk vainly
with his Brothers, and as it were, think every godly opportunity
seven times as long as it was, gruding till it was over.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This his abhorring of that day, was not, I think,
for the sake of the day itself: for as it is a day, it is nothing
else but as other days of the Week: But I suppose it were, think
every godly as it was, grudging till it that day, was not, I
think) as it is a day, it is nothing of the Week: But I suppose
that the <a name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b"
class="citation">[28b]</a> reason of his loathing of it, was, for
that God hath put sanctity and holiness upon it; also because it
is the day above all the days of the week that ought to be spent
in holy Devotion, in remembrance of our Lords Resurrection from
the dead.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes, &rsquo;twas therefore, that he was such an
enemy to it, even because more restraint was laid upon him on
that day, from his own ways, than were possible should be laid
upon him on all others.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Doth not God by instituting of a day unto holy
Duties, make great proof how the hearts and inclinations of poor
people do stand to Holiness of heart, and a Conversation in
[h]oly duties?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; <a name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a> Yes doubtless; and a man shall shew
his Heart and his Life what they are, more by one Lords-day, than
by all the days of the week besides: And the reason is, because
on the Lords-day there is a special restraint laid upon men as to
Thoughts and Life, more than upon other days of the week
besides.&nbsp; Also, men are enjoyned on that day to a stricter
performance of holy Duties, and restraint of worldly business,
than upon other days they are; wherefore, if their hearts incline
not naturally to good, now they will shew it, now they will
appear what they are.&nbsp; The Lords Day is a kind of an Emblem
of the heavenly Sabbath above, and it makes manifest how the
heart stands to the perpetuity of Holiness, more than to be found
in a transient Duty, does.</p>
<p>On other days a man may be in and out of holy Duties, and all
in a quarter of an hour; but now, the Lords Day is, as it were, a
day that enjoyns to one perpetual Duty of Holiness: Remember that
thou keep holy the Sabbath day, <a name="citation29b"></a><a
href="#footnote29b" class="citation">[29b]</a> (which by Christ
is not abrogated, but changed, into the First of the week,) not
as it was given in particular to the Jews, but as it was
sanctified by him from the Beginning of the world; and therefore
is a greater proof of the frame and temper of a mans heart, and
does more make manifest to what he is inclined, than doth his
other performance of Duties: Therefore God puts great difference
between them that truly call (and walk in) this day as holy, and
count it Honourable, <a name="citation29c"></a><a
href="#footnote29c" class="citation">[29c]</a> upon the account
that now they have an opportunity to shew how they delight to
honour him; <a name="citation29d"></a><a href="#footnote29d"
class="citation">[29d]</a> in that they have, not only an Hour,
but a whole Day to shew it in: I say, he puts great difference
between these, and that other sort that say, When will the
Sabbath be gone, that we may be at our worldly business. <a
name="citation29e"></a><a href="#footnote29e"
class="citation">[29e]</a>&nbsp; The first he calleth a Blessed
man, but brandeth the other for an unsanctified worldling.&nbsp;
And indeed, to delight ourselves in Gods service upon his Holy
days, gives a better proof of a sanctified Nature, than to grudge
at the coming, and to be weary of the holy duties of such dayes,
as Mr. Badman did.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; There may be something in what you say, for he
that cannot abide to keep one day holy to God, to be sure he hath
given a sufficient proof that he is an unsanctified man; and as
such, what should he do in Heaven? that being the place where a
perpetual Sabath is to be kept to God; <a
name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a> I say, to be kept for ever and
ever.&nbsp; And for ought I know, one reason why one day in
seven, hath been by our Lord set apart unto holy Duties for men,
may be to give them conviction that there is enmity in the hearts
of sinners to the God of Heaven, for he that hateth Holiness,
hateth God himself.&nbsp; They pretend to love God, and yet love
not a holy day, and yet love not to spend that day in one
continued act of holiness to the Lord: They had as good say
nothing as to call him Lord, Lord, and yet not doe the things
that he says.&nbsp; And this Mr. Badman was such an one: he could
not abide this day, nor any of the Duties of it.&nbsp; Indeed,
when he could get from his Friends, and so <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a> spend it in all manner of idleness and
profaneness, then he would be pleased well enough: but what was
this but a turning the day into night, or other than taking an
opportunity at Gods forbidding, to follow our Callings, to solace
and satisfie our lusts and delights of the flesh.&nbsp; I take
the liberty to speak thus of Mr. Badman, upon a confidence of
what you, Sir, have said of him, is true.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You needed not to have made that Apology for your
censuring of Mr. Badman, for all that knew him, will confirm what
you said of him to be true.&nbsp; He could not abide either that
day, or any thing else that had the stamp or image of God upon
it.&nbsp; Sin, sin, and to do the thing that was naught, was that
which he delighted in, and that from a little Child.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I must say again, I am sorry to hear it, and that
for his own sake, and also for the sake of his Relations, who
must needs be broken to pieces with such doings as these: For,
for these things sake comes the wrath of God upon the Children of
disobedience: <a name="citation30c"></a><a href="#footnote30c"
class="citation">[30c]</a> and doubtless he must be gone to Hell,
if he died without Repentance; and to beget a Child for Hell, is
sad for Parents to think on.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Of his Dying, as I told you, I will give you a
Relation anon, but now we are upon his Life, and upon the Manner
of his Life in his Childhood, even of the sins that attended him
then, some of which I have mentioned already; and indeed I have
mentioned but some, for yet there are more to follow, and those
not at all inferiour to what you have already heard.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray what were they?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why he was greatly given, and that while a Lad, to
grievous <a name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a> Swearing and Cursing: yea, he then
made no more of Swearing and Cursing, than I do of telling my
fingers.&nbsp; Yea, he would do it without provocation
thereto.&nbsp; He counted it a glory to Swear and Curse, and it
was as natural to him, as to eat and drink and sleep.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Oh! what a young Villain was this! here is, as
the Apostle says, a yielding of Members as instruments of
unrighteousness unto sin, <a name="citation31b"></a><a
href="#footnote31b" class="citation">[31b]</a> indeed!&nbsp; This
is proceeding from evil to evil with a witness; This argueth that
he was a black-mouthed young Wretch indeed.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; He was so; and yet, as I told you, he counted,
above all, this kind of sinning, to be <a
name="citation31c"></a><a href="#footnote31c"
class="citation">[31c]</a> a Badge of his Honour: He reckoned
himself a mans Fellow when he had learnt to Swear and Curse
boldly.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I am perswaded that many do think, as you have
said, that to Swear, is a thing that does bravely become them,
and that it is the best way for a man, when he would put
authority, or terrour into his words, to stuff them full of the
sin of Swearing.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You say right, else, as I am perswaded, men would
not so usually belch out their blasphemous Oaths, as they do:
they take a pride in it; they think that to swear is
Gentleman-like; and having once accustomed themselves unto it,
they hardly leave it all the days of their lives.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but now we are upon it, pray shew me <a
name="citation31d"></a><a href="#footnote31d"
class="citation">[31d]</a> the difference between Swearing and
Cursing; for there is a difference, is there not?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes: There is a difference between Swearing and
Cursing, Swearing, vain swearing, such as young Badman accustomed
himself unto.&nbsp; Now vain and sinful swearing, <a
name="citation31e"></a><a href="#footnote31e"
class="citation">[31e]</a> Is a light and wicked calling of God,
&amp;c. to witness to our vain and foolish attesting of things,
and those things are of two sorts.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Things that we swear, are, or shall be done.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Things so sworn to, true or false.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Things that we swear, are, or shall be done.&nbsp;
Thou swearest thou hast done such a thing, that such a thing is
so, or shall be so; for it is no matter which of these it is that
men swear about, if it be done lightly and wickedly, and
groundlesly, it is vain, because it is a sin against the Third
Commandement, which says, Thou shalt not take the Name of the
Lord thy God in vain. <a name="citation32a"></a><a
href="#footnote32a" class="citation">[32a]</a>&nbsp; For this is
a vain using of that Holy and Sacred Name, and so a sin for
which, without sound Repentance, there is not, nor can be rightly
expected, forgiveness.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Then it seems, though as to the matter of fact, a
man swears truely, yet if he sweareth lightly and groundlesly,
his Oath is evil, and he by it, under sin.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes; a man may say, <a name="citation32b"></a><a
href="#footnote32b" class="citation">[32b]</a> The Lord liveth,
and that is true, and yet in so saying, swear falsly; because he
sweareth vainly, needlesly, and without a ground.&nbsp; To swear
groundedly and necessarily, (which then a man does, when he
swears as being called thereto of God,) that is tolerated of the
Word: but this was none of Mr. Badmans swearing, and therefore
that which now we are not concerned about.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I perceive, by the Prophet, that a man may sin in
swearing to a Truth: They therefore must needs most horribly sin,
that swear to confirm their Jests and Lies; and as they think,
the better to beautifie their foolish talking.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; They sin with an high hand; for they presume to
imagine, <a name="citation32c"></a><a href="#footnote32c"
class="citation">[32c]</a> that God is as wicked as themselves,
to wit, that he is an Avoucher of Lies to be true.&nbsp; For, as
I said before, to swear, is to call God to witness; and to swear
to a Lie, is to call God himself, to witness that that Lie is
true.&nbsp; This therefore must needs offend; for it puts the
highest affront upon the Holiness and Righteousness of God,
therefore his wrath must sweep them away.&nbsp; This kind of
Swearing is put in with lying, and killing, and stealing, and
committing Adultery; and therefore must not go unpunished: <a
name="citation32d"></a><a href="#footnote32d"
class="citation">[32d]</a> For if God will not hold him guiltless
that taketh his Name in vain, which a man may doe when he swears
to a truth, (as I have shewed before,) how can it be imagined,
that he should hold such guiltless, who, by Swearing, will appeal
to God, if Lies be not true, or that swear out of their frantick
and Bedlam madness.&nbsp; It would grieve and provoke a sober man
to wrath, if one should swear to a notorious lye, and avouch that
that man would attest it for a truth; and yet thus do men deal
with the holy God: They tell their Jestings, Tales and Lies, and
then swear by God that they are true.&nbsp; Now this kind of
Swearing was as common with young Badman, as it was to eat when
he was an hungred, or to go to bed when it was night.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I have often mused in my mind, what it should be
that should make men so common in the use of the sin of Swearing,
since those that be wise, will believe them never the sooner for
that.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It cannot be any thing that is good, you may be
sure; because the thing it self is abominable: <a
name="citation33a"></a><a href="#footnote33a"
class="citation">[33a]</a> 1.&nbsp; Therefore it must be from the
promptings of the spirit of the Devil within them.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;
Also it flows sometimes from hellish Rage, when the tongue hath
set on fire of Hell even the whole course of nature. <a
name="citation33b"></a><a href="#footnote33b"
class="citation">[33b]</a> 3.&nbsp; But commonly Swearing flows
from that daring Boldness that biddeth defiance to the Law that
forbids it.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Swearers think also that by their
belching of their blasphemous Oaths out of their black and
polluted mouths, they shew themselves the more valiant men:
5.&nbsp; And imagine also, that by these outrageous kind of
villianies, they shall conquer those that at such a time they
have to do with, and make them believe their lyes to be
true.&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; They also swear frequently to get Gain
thereby, and when they meet with fools, they overcome them this
way.&nbsp; But if I might give advice in this matter, no Buyer
should lay out one farthing with him that is a common Swearer in
his Calling; especially with such an Oath-master that
endeavoureth to swear away his commodity to another, and that
would swear his Chapmans money into his own pocket.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; All these causes of Swearing, so far as I can
perceive, flow from the same Root as doe the Oaths themselves,
even from a hardened and desperate heart.&nbsp; But pray shew me
now how wicked cursing is to be distinguished from this kind of
swearing.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; <a name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a> Swearing, as I said, hath immediately
to do with the Name of God, and it calls upon him to be witness
to the truth of what is said: That is, if they that swear, swear
by him.&nbsp; Some indeed swear by Idols, as by the Mass, by our
Lady, by Saints, Beasts, Birds, and other creatures; but the
usual way of our profane ones in England, is to swear by God,
Christ, Faith, and the like: But however, or by whatever they
swear, Cursing is distinguished from Swearing thus.</p>
<p>To <a name="citation34b"></a><a href="#footnote34b"
class="citation">[34b]</a> Curse, to Curse profanely, it is to
sentence another or our self, for, or to evil: or to wish that
some evil might happen to the person or thing under the Curse,
unjustly.</p>
<p>It is to sentence for, or to evil, (that is, without a cause):
Thus Shimei cursed David: He sentenced him for and to evil
unjustly, when he said to him, Come out, come out thou bloody
man, and thou man of Belial.&nbsp; The Lord hath returned upon
thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast
reigned, and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of
Absalom thy son: and behold thou art taken in thy mischief,
because thou art a bloody man. <a name="citation34c"></a><a
href="#footnote34c" class="citation">[34c]</a></p>
<p>This David calls a grievous Curse.&nbsp; And behold, saith he
to Solomon his Son, thou hast with thee Shimei a Benjamite, which
cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to
Mahanaim. <a name="citation34d"></a><a href="#footnote34d"
class="citation">[34d]</a></p>
<p>But what was this Curse?&nbsp; Why, First, It was a wrong
sentence past upon David; Shimei called him Bloody man, man of
Belial, when he was not.&nbsp; Secondly, He sentenced him to the
evil that at present was upon him, for being a bloody man, (that
is, against the house of Saul,) when that present evil overtook
David, for quite another thing.</p>
<p>And we may thus apply it to the <a name="citation34e"></a><a
href="#footnote34e" class="citation">[34e]</a> profane ones of
our times who in their rage and envy, have little else in their
mouths but a sentence against their Neighbour for, and to evil
unjustly.&nbsp; How common is it with many, when they are but a
little offended with one, to cry, Hang him, Damn him,
Rogue!&nbsp; This is both a sentencing of him for, and to evil,
and is in it self a grievous Curse.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The other kind of Cursing, is to wish that some evil
might happen to, and overtake this or that person or thing: And
this kind of Cursing, Job counted a grievous sin.&nbsp; I have
not suffered (says he) my mouth to sin, <a
name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a> by wishing a curse to his soul; or
consequently, to Body or Estate.&nbsp; This then is a wicked
cursing, to wish that evil might either befall another or our
selves: And this kind of cursing young Badman accustomed himself
unto.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; He <a name="citation35b"></a><a href="#footnote35b"
class="citation">[35b]</a> would wish that evil might befall
others; he would wish their Necks broken, or that their Brains
were out, or that the Pox, or Plague was upon them, and the like:
All which is a devilish kind of cursing, and is become one of the
common sins of our age.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; He would also as often wish a Curse to himself,
saying, Would I might be hanged, or burned, or that the Devil
might fetch me, if it be not so, or the like.&nbsp; We count the
<a name="citation35c"></a><a href="#footnote35c"
class="citation">[35c]</a> Damme Blades to be great Swearers; but
when in their hellish fury they say, God-damme me, God perish me,
or the like, they rather curse than swear; yea, curse themselves,
and that with a Wish that Damnation might light upon themselves;
which wish and Curse of theirs, in a little time, they will see
accomplished upon them, even in Hell-fire, if they repent not of
their sins.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But did this young Badman accustom himself to
such filthy kind of language?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I think I may say, that nothing was more frequent
in his mouth, and that upon the least provocation.&nbsp; Yea he
was so versed in such kind of language, that neither <a
name="citation35d"></a><a href="#footnote35d"
class="citation">[35d]</a> Father, nor Mother, nor Brother, nor
Sister, nor Servant, no nor the very Cattel that his Father had,
could escape these Curses of his.&nbsp; I say, that even the
bruit Beasts when he drove them, or rid upon them, if they
pleased not his humour, they must be sure to partake of his
curse.&nbsp; <a name="citation35e"></a><a href="#footnote35e"
class="citation">[35e]</a> He would wish their Necks broke, their
Legs broke, their Guts out, or that the Devil might fetch them,
or the like: and no marvel, for he that is so hardy to wish
damnation, or other bad curses to himself, or dearest relations;
will not stick to wish evil to the silly Beast, in his
madness.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, I see still that this Badman was a
desperate villain.&nbsp; But pray, Sir, since you have gone thus
far, now shew me whence this evil of cursing ariseth, and also
what dishonour it bringeth to God; for I easily discern that it
doth bring damnation to the soul.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; This evil of Cursing ariseth, in general, from the
desperate wickedness of the heart, but particularly from, <a
name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a> <a name="citation36b"></a><a
href="#footnote36b" class="citation">[36b]</a> 1.&nbsp; Envie,
which is, as I apprehend, the leading sin to Witchcraft.&nbsp;
2.&nbsp; It also ariseth from Pride which was the sin of the
fallen Angels; 3.&nbsp; It ariseth too from Scorn and contempt of
others: 4.&nbsp; But for a man to curse himself, must needs arise
from desperate Madness.</p>
<p>The <a name="citation36c"></a><a href="#footnote36c"
class="citation">[36c]</a> dishonour that it bringeth to God, is
this.&nbsp; It taketh away from him his Authority, in whose power
it is onely, to Bless and Curse; not to Curse wickedly, as Mr.
Badman, but justly, and righteously, giving by his Curse to those
that are wicked, the due Reward of their deeds.</p>
<p>Besides, these wicked men, in their wicked cursing of their
Neighbour, &amp;c. do even Curse God himself in his handy
work.&nbsp; Man is Gods Image, and to curse wickedly the Image of
God, is to curse God himself. <a name="citation36d"></a><a
href="#footnote36d" class="citation">[36d]</a>&nbsp; Therefore as
when men wickedly swear, they rend, and tare Gods Name, and make
him, as much as in them lies, the avoucher and approver of all
their wickedness; so he that curseth and condemneth in this sort
his Neighbour, or that wisheth him evil, curseth, condemneth, and
wisheth evil to the Image of God, and consequently judgeth and
condemneth God himself.</p>
<p>Suppose that a man should say with his mouth, I wish that the
Kings Picture was burned; would not this mans so saying, render
him as an Enemy to the Person of the King?&nbsp; Even so it is
with them that, by cursing, wish evil to their neighbour, or to
themselves, they contemn the Image, even the Image of God
himself.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But do you think that the men that do thus, do
think that they do so vilely, so abominably?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; The question is not what men do believe concerning
their sin, but what Gods Word says of it: If Gods Word says that
Swearing and Cursing are sins, though men should count them for
Vertues, their reward will be a reward for sin, to wit, the
damnation of the soul.</p>
<p>To <a name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a"
class="citation">[37a]</a> curse another, and to swear vainly and
falsly, are sins against the Light of Nature.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; To Curse is so, because, whoso curseth another,
knows, that at the same time he would not be so served
himself.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; To Swear also, is a sin against the same Law: for
Nature will tell me, that I should not lie, and therefore much
less Swear to confirm it.&nbsp; Yea, the Heathens have looked
upon Swearing to be a solemn Ordinance of God, and therefore not
to be lightly or vainly used by men, though to confirm a matter
of truth. <a name="citation37b"></a><a href="#footnote37b"
class="citation">[37b]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But I wonder, since Curseing and Swearing are
such evils in the eyes of God, that he doth not make some
Examples to others, for their committing such wickedness.</p>

</a>Wise.&nbsp; Alas! so he has, a thousand times twice told, as
may be easily gathered by any observing people in every Age and
Countrey.&nbsp; I could present you with several my self; but
waving the abundance that might be mentioned, I will here present
you with <a name="citation37c"></a><a href="#footnote37c"
class="citation">[37c]</a> two; One was that dreadful Judgment of
God upon one N. P. at Wimbleton in Surrey; who, after a horrible
fit of Swearing at, and Cursing of some persons that did not
please him, suddenly fell sick, and in little time died raving,
cursing and swearing.</p>
<p>But above all take that dreadful Story of Dorothy Mately an
Inhabitant of As[h]over in the County of Darby.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"

"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>This Dorothy Mately, saith the Relator, was noted by the
people of the Town to be a great Swearer, and Curser, and Lier,
and Thief; (just like Mr. Badman.)&nbsp; And the labour that she
did usually follow, was to wash the Rubbish that came forth of
the Lead Mines, and there to get sparks of Lead-Ore; and her
usual way of asserting of things, was with these kind of
Imprecations: I would I might sink into the earth if it be not
so, or I would God would make the earth open and swallow me
up.&nbsp; Now upon the 23. of March, 1660. this Dorothy was
washing of Ore upon the top of a steep Hill, about a quarter of a
mile from Ashover, and was there taxed by a Lad for taking of two
single Pence out of his Pocket, (for he had laid his Breeches by,
and was at work in his Drawers;) but she violently denyed it,
wishing, That the ground might swallow her up if she had them:
She also used the same wicked words on several other occasions
that day.</p>
<p>Now one George Hodgkinson of Ashover, a man of good report
there, came accidentally by where this Dorothy was, and stood
still a while to talk with her, as she was washing her Ore; there
stood also a little Child by her Tub-side, and another a distance
from her, calling aloud to her to come away; wherefore the said
George took the Girle by the hand to lead her away to her that
called her: But behold, they had not gone above ten yards from
Dorothy, but they heard her crying out for help; so looking back,
he saw the Woman, and her Tub, and Sive, twirling round, and
sinking into the ground.&nbsp; Then said the man, Pray to God to
pardon thy sin, for thou art never like to be seen alive any
longer.&nbsp; So she and her Tub twirled round, and round, till
they sunk about three yards into the Earth, and then for a while
staid.&nbsp; Then she called for help again, thinking, as she
said, that she should stay there.&nbsp; Now the man though
greatly amazed, did begin to think which way to help her, but
immediately a great stone which appeared in the Earth, fell upon
her head, and brake her Skull, and then the Earth fell in upon
her and covered her.&nbsp; She was afterwards digged up, and
found about four yards within ground, with the Boys two single
Pence in her pocket, but her Tub and Sive could not be found.</p>

<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=

</a>Atten.&nbsp; You bring to my mind a sad story, the which I
will relate unto you.&nbsp; The thing is this; About a bow-shoot
from where I once dwelt, there was a blind Ale-house, and the man
that kept it had a Son whose name was Edward.&nbsp; This Edward
was, as it were, an half-fool, both in his words, and manner of
behaviour.&nbsp; To this blind Ale-house certain jovial
companions would once or twice a week come, and this Ned, (for so
they called him) his Father would entertain his guests withall;
to wit, by calling for him to make them sport by his foolish
words and gestures.&nbsp; So when these boon blades came to this
mans house, the Father would call for Ned: Ned therefore would
come forth; and the villain was devilishly addicted to cursing,
yea to cursing his Father and Mother, and any one else that did
cross him.&nbsp; And because (though he was an half-fool) he saw
that his practice was pleasing, he would do it with the more
audaciousness.</p>
<p>Well, when these brave fellows did come at their times to this
Tippling-house (as they call it) to fuddle and make merry, then
must Ned be called out; and because his Father was best
acquainted with Ned, and best knew how to provoke him, therefore
He would usually ask him such questions, or command him such
business, as would be sure to provoke him indeed.&nbsp; Then
would he (after his foolish manner) Curse his Father most
bitterly; at which the old man would laugh, (and so would the
rest of the guests, as at that which pleased them best) still
continuing to ask, that Ned still might be provoked to curse,
that they might still be provoked to laugh.&nbsp; This was the
mirth with which the old man did use to entertain his guests.</p>
<p>The curses wherewith this Ned did use to curse his father, and
at which the old man would laugh, were these, and such like: The
Devil take you; The Devil fetch you: He would also wish him
Plagues and Destructions many.&nbsp; Well, so it came to pass,
through the righteous Judgement of God, that Neds Wishes and
Curses were in a little time fuelled upon his Father; for not
many months passed between them after this manner, but the Devil
did indeed take him, possess him, and also in few days carried
him out of this world by death; I say, Satan did take him and
possess him: I mean, so it was judged by those that knew him, and
had to do with him in that his lamentable condition.&nbsp; He
could feel him like a live thing goe up and down in his body, but
when tormenting time was come (as he had often tormenting fits)
then he would lye like an hard bump in the soft place of his
chest, (I mean, I saw it so,) and so would rent and tare him, and
make him roar till he died away.</p>
<p>I told you before, that I was an ear and eye witness of what I
here say; and so I was.&nbsp; I have heard Ned in his Roguery,
cursing his Father, and his Father laughing thereat most
heartily; still provoking of Ned to curse, that his mirth might
be encreased.&nbsp; I saw his Father also, when he was possessed,
I saw him in one of his fits, and saw his flesh (as &rsquo;twas
thought) by the Devil, gathered up on an heap, about the bigness
of half in Egge; to the unutterable torture and afflict[i]on of
the old man.&nbsp; There was also one Freeman, (who was more than
an ordinary Doctor) sent for, to cast out this Devil; and I was
there when he attempted to do it.&nbsp; The manner whereof was
this.&nbsp; They had the possessed into an out-room, and laid him
on his belly upon a Form, with his head hanging over the Forms
end; then they bound him down thereto: which done, they set a pan
of Coals under his mouth, and put something therein which made a
great smoak; by this means (as &rsquo;twas said) to fetch out the
Devil.&nbsp; There therefore they kept the man till he was almost
smothered in the smoak, but no Devil came out of him; at which
Freeman was somewhat abashed, the man greatly afflicted, and I
made to go away wondering and fearing.&nbsp; In a little time
therefore that which possessed the man, carried him out of the
World, according to the cursed Wishes of his Son.&nbsp; And this
was the end of this hellish mirth.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; These were all sad Judgements.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; These were dreadful Judgments indeed.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Ai, and they look like the Threatning of that
Text, (though chiefly it concerned Judas,) As he loved cursing,
so let it come unto him; as he delighted not in blessing, so let
it be far from him.&nbsp; As he cloathed himself with cursing as
with a garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and as
oyl into his bones. <a name="citation40a"></a><a
href="#footnote40a" class="citation">[40a]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; It is a fearful thing for Youth to be trained up
in a way of Cursing and Swearing.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Trained up in them! that I cannot say Mr. Badman
was, for his Father hath oft-times in my hearing, bewailed the
badness of his Children, and of this naughty Boy in
particular.&nbsp; I believe that the wickedness of his Children
made him (in the thoughts of it) goe many a Night with heavy
heart to bed, and with as heavy an one to rise in the
Morning.&nbsp; But all was one to his graceless Son, neither
wholsom counsel, nor fatherly sorrow, would make him mend his
Manners.</p>
<p>There <a name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b"
class="citation">[40b]</a> are some indeed that do train up their
Children to swear, curse, lye and steal, and great is the misery
of such poor Children whose hard hap it is to be ushered into the
world by, and to be under the tuition too of such ungodly
Parents.&nbsp; It had been better for such Parents, had they not
begat them, and better for such Children had they not been
born.&nbsp; O! methinks for a Father or a Mother to train up a
Child in that very way that leadeth to Hell and Damnation, what
thing so horrible!&nbsp; But Mr. Badman was not by his Parents so
brought up.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But methinks, since this Young Badman would not
be ruled at home, his Father should have tryed what good could
have been done of him abroad, by putting him out to some man of
his acquaintance, that he knew to be able to command him, and to
keep him pretty hard to some employ: So should he, at least, have
been prevented of time to do those wickednesses that could not be
done without time to do them in.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Alas, his Father did so, <a
name="citation41a"></a><a href="#footnote41a"
class="citation">[41a]</a> he put him out betimes to one of his
own Acquaintance, and entreated him of all love, that he would
take care of Son, and keep him from extravagant wayes.&nbsp; His
Trade also was honest and commodious; he had besides a full
Employ therein, so that this young Badman had no vacant seasons
nor idle hours yielded him by his Calling, therein to take
opportunities to do Badly: but all was one to him, as he had
begun to be vile in his Fathers house, even so he continued to be
when he was in the house of his Master.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I have known some Children, who though they have
been very Bad at home, yet have altered much when they have been
put out abroad; especially when they have fallen into a Family,
where the Governours thereof have made conscience of maintaining
of the Worship and Service of God therein; but perhaps that might
be wanting in Mr. Badmans Masters house.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Indeed some Children do greatly mend, when put
under other mens Roofs; but, as I said, this naughty boy did not
so; nor did his badness continue, because he wanted a Master that
both could and did correct it: For his <a
name="citation41b"></a><a href="#footnote41b"
class="citation">[41b]</a> Master was a very good man, a very
devout person; one that frequented the best Soul-means, that set
up the Worship of God in his Family, and also that walked himself
thereafter.&nbsp; He was also a man very meek and merciful, one
that did never overdrive young Badman in business, nor that kept
him at it at unseasonable hours.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Say you so!&nbsp; This is rare: I for my part can
see but few that can parallel, in these things, with Mr. Badmans
Master.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Nor I neither, (yet Mr. Badman had such an one;)
for, for the most past, <a name="citation42a"></a><a
href="#footnote42a" class="citation">[42a]</a> Masters are now a
days such as mind nothing but their worldly concerns, and if
Apprentices do but answer their commands therein, Soul and
Religion may go whither they will.&nbsp; Yea, I much fear, that
there have been many towardly Lads put out by their parents to
such Masters, that have quite undone them as to the next
world.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; The more is the pity.&nbsp; But pray, now you
have touched upon this subject, shew me how many wages a Master
may be the ruin of his poor Apprentice.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Nay, I cannot tell you of all the wayes, yet some
of them I will mention.</p>
<p>Suppose then that a towardly Lad be put to be an Apprentice
with one that is reputed to be a Godly man, yet that Lad may be
ruined many wayes; that is, if his Master be not circumspect in
all things that respect both God and man, and that before his
Apprentice.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; If <a name="citation42b"></a><a href="#footnote42b"
class="citation">[42b]</a> he be not moderate in the use of his
Apprentice; if he drives him beyond his strength; if he holds him
to work at unseasonable hours; if he will not allow him
convenient time to read the Word, to Pray, &amp;c.&nbsp; This is
the way to destroy him; that is, in those tender begin[n]ings of
good thoughts, and good beginnings about spiritual things.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If he suffers his house to be scattered with profane
and wicked Books, such as stir up to lust, to wantonness, such as
teach idle, wanton, lascivious discourse, and such as has a
tendency to provoke to profane drollery and Jesting; and lastly,
such as tend to corrupt, and pervert the Doctrine of Faith and
Holiness.&nbsp; All these things will eat as doth a canker, and
will quickly spoil, in Youth, &amp;c. those good beginnings that
may be putting forth themselves in them.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; If there be a mixture of Servants, that is, if some
very bad be in the same place, that&rsquo;s a way also to undo
such tender Lads; for they that are bad and sordid Servants, will
be often (and they have an opportunity too, to be) distilling and
fomenting of their profane and wicked words and tricks before
them, and these will easily stick in the flesh and minds of
Youth, to the corrupting of them.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; If the Master have one Guise for abroad, and another
for home; that is, if his Religion hangs by in his house as his
Cloak does, and he be seldom in it, except he be abroad; this,
young beginners will take notice of, and stumble at.&nbsp; We
say, Hedges have eyes, and little Pitchers have ears; and indeed,
<a name="citation43a"></a><a href="#footnote43a"
class="citation">[43a]</a> Children make a greater inspection
into the Lives of Fathers, Masters, &amp;c. than oft-times they
are aware of: And therefore should Masters be carefull, else they
may soon destroy good beginnings in their Servants.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; If the Master be unconscionable in his Dealing, and
trades with lying words; or if bad Commodities be avouched to be
good, or if he seeks after unreasonable gain, or the like; his
servant sees it, and it is enough to undo him.&nbsp; Elies Sons
being bad before the congregation, made Men despise the
sacrifices of the Lord. <a name="citation43b"></a><a
href="#footnote43b" class="citation">[43b]</a></p>
<p>But these things by the by, only they may serve for a hint to
Masters to take heed that they take not Apprentices to destroy
their Souls.&nbsp; But young Badman had none of these
hinderances; <a name="citation43c"></a><a href="#footnote43c"
class="citation">[43c]</a> His father took care, and provided
well for him, as to this: He had a good Master, he wanted not
good Books, nor good Instruction, nor good Sermons, nor good
Examples, no nor good fellow-Servants neither: but all would not
doe.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a wonder, that in such a Family,
amidst so many spiritual helps, nothing should take hold of his
heart!&nbsp; What! not good Books, nor good Instructions, nor
good Sermons, nor good Examples, nor good fellow-Servants, nor
nothing do him good!</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You talk, he minded none of these things; nay, all
these were <a name="citation43d"></a><a href="#footnote43d"
class="citation">[43d]</a> abominable to him.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; For good Books, they might lie in his Masters house
till they rotted for him, he would not regard to look into them;
but, contrary-wise, would get all the bad and abominable Books
that he could, as beastly Romances, and books full of Ribbauldry,
even such as immediately tended to set all fleshly lusts on
fire.&nbsp; True, he durst not be known to have any of these, to
his Master; therefore would he never let them be seen by him, but
would keep them in close places, and peruse them at such times,
as yielded him fit opportunities thereto.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; For good Instruction, he liked that, much as he liked
good books; his care was to hear but little thereof, and to
forget what he heard as soon as &rsquo;twas spoken.&nbsp; Yea, I
have heard some that knew him then, say, that one might evidently
discern by the shew of his countenance and gestures, that good
counsel was to him like <a name="citation44a"></a><a
href="#footnote44a" class="citation">[44a]</a> little-ease, even
a continual torment to him; nor did he ever count himself at
liberty, but when farthest off of wholsom words.&nbsp; He would
hate them that rebuked him, and count them his deadly
enemies.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; For good Example; which was frequently set him by his
Master, both in Religious and Civil matters; these, young Badman
would laugh at, and would also make a byword of them, when he
came in place where he with safety could.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; His Master indeed would make him go with him to
Sermons, and that where he thought the best Preachers were, but
this ungodly young man, what shall I say, was (I think) a Master
of Art in all mischief; he had these wicked ways to hinder
himself of hearing, let the Preacher thunder never so loud.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; His <a name="citation44b"></a><a href="#footnote44b"
class="citation">[44b]</a> way was, when come into the place of
hearing, to sit down in some corner, and then to fall fast
asleep.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Or else to fix his adulterous eyes upon some
beautifull Object that was in the place, and so all Sermon-while,
therewith be feeding of his fleshly lusts.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Or, if he could get near to some that he had observed
would fit his humour, he would be whispering, gigling, and
playing with them, till such time as Sermon was done.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Why! he was grown to a prodigious height of
wickedness.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; He was so, and that which aggravates all, was,
this was his practice as soon as he was come to his Master, he
was as ready at all these things, as if he had, before he came to
his Master, served an Apprentiship to learn them.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; There could not but be added (as you relate them)
Rebellion to his sin.&nbsp; Methinks it is as if he had said, I
will not hear, I will not regard, I will not mind good, I will
not mend, I will not turn, I will not be converted.</p>

</a>Wise.&nbsp; You say true, and I know not to whom more fitly
to compare him, <a name="citation45b"></a><a href="#footnote45b"
class="citation">[45b]</a> than to that man, who when I my self
rebuked him for his wickedness, in this great huff replied; What
would the Devil do for company, if it was not for such as I.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Why did you ever hear any man say so.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes, that I did; and this young Badman was as like
him, as an Egg is like an Egg.&nbsp; Alas! the Scripture makes
mention of many that by their actions speak the same.&nbsp; They
say unto God, Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of
thy ways; Again, They refuse to hearken, and pull away their
shoulder, and stop their ears; yea, they make their hearts hard
as an Adamant-stone, lest they should hear the Law, and the words
that the Lord of Host[s] hath sent. <a name="citation45c"></a><a
href="#footnote45c" class="citation">[45c]</a>&nbsp; What are all
these but such as Badman, and such as the young man but now
mentioned?&nbsp; That young man was my Play-fellow when I was
solacing my self in my sins: I may make mention of him to my
shame; but he has a great many fellows.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Young Badman was like him indeed, and he trod his
steps, as if his wickedness had been his very Copy; I mean, as to
his desperateness: for had he not been a desperate one, he would
never have made you such a reply, when you was rebuking of him
for his sin.&nbsp; But when did you give him such a rebuke?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; A while after God had parted him and I, by Calling
of me (as I hope) by his Grace, still leaving him in his sins;
and so far as I could ever gather, as he lived, so he died, even
as Mr. Badman did: but we will leave him, and return again to our
discourse.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Ha, poor obstinate sinners! doe they think that
God cannot be even with them?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I do not know, what they think, but I know that
God hath said, That as He cried, and they would not hear, so they
shall crie, and I will not hear, saith the Lord.&nbsp; <a
name="citation45d"></a><a href="#footnote45d"
class="citation">[45d]</a> Doubtless there is a time a coming,
when Mr. Badman will crie for this.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But I wonder that he should be so expert in
wickedness, so soon! alas, he was but a Stripling, I suppose, he
was, as yet, not Twenty.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; No, nor Eighteen neither: but (as with Ishmael,
and with the Children that mocked the Prophet) the seeds of sin
did put forth themselves betimes in him. <a
name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, he was as wicked a young man as commonly
one shall hear of.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You will say so, when you know all.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; All, I think here is a great All; but if there is
more behind, pray let us hear it.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why, then I will tell you, that he had not been
with his Master much above a year and a half, but he came <a
name="citation46b"></a><a href="#footnote46b"
class="citation">[46b]</a> acquainted with three young Villains
(who here shall be nameless,) that taught him to adde to his sin,
much of like kind; and he as aptly received their
Instructions.&nbsp; One of them was chiefly given to Uncleanness,
another to Drunkenness; and the third to Purloining, or stealing
from his Master.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Alas poor Wretch, he was bad enough before, but
these, I suppose, made him much worse.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; That they made him worse you may be sure of, for
they taught him to be an Arch, a chief one in all their
wayes.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; It was an ill hap that he ever came acqu[a]inted
with them.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You must rather word it thus.&nbsp; It <a
name="citation46c"></a><a href="#footnote46c"
class="citation">[46c]</a> was the Judgement of God that he did;
that is, he came acquainted with them, through the anger of
God.&nbsp; He had a good Master, and before him a good Father: By
these he had good counsel given him for Months and Years
together; but his heart was set upon mischief, he loved
wickedness more than to do good, even untill his Iniquity came to
be hateful; therefore, from the anger of God it was, that these
companions of his, and he, did at last so acquaint
together.&nbsp; Sayes Paul, They did not like to retain God in
their knowledge; <a name="citation46d"></a><a href="#footnote46d"
class="citation">[46d]</a> and what follows? wherefore, God gave
them over, or up to their own hearts lusts.&nbsp; And again, As
for such as turn aside to their own crooked wayes, the Lord shall
lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. <a
name="citation46e"></a><a href="#footnote46e"
class="citation">[46e]</a>&nbsp; This therefore was Gods hand
upon him, that he might be destroyed, be damned; because he
received not the love of the Truth that he might be saved.&nbsp;
He chose his Delusions and Deluders for him, even the company of
base men, of Fools, that he might be destroyed. <a
name="citation46f"></a><a href="#footnote46f"
class="citation">[46f]</a> <a name="citation47a"></a><a
href="#footnote47a" class="citation">[47a]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I cannot but think indeed, that it is a Great
Judgment of God for a man to be given up to the company of vile
men; for what are such but the Devils <a
name="citation47b"></a><a href="#footnote47b"
class="citation">[47b]</a>&nbsp; Decoyes, even those by whom he
drawes the simple into the Net?&nbsp; A Whoremaster, a Drunkard,
a Thiefe, what are they but the Devils baits, by which he
catcheth others?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You say right; but this young Badman was no simple
one, if by simple, you mean one uninstructed; for he had often
good counsel given him: but if by simple, you mean, him that is a
Fool as to the true Knowledge of, and Faith in Christ, then he
was a simple one indeed: for he chose death, rather than life,
and to live in continual opposition to God, rather than to be
Reconciled unto him; according to that saying of the wise man;
The fooles hated knowledge, and did not choose the Fear of the
Lord: <a name="citation47c"></a><a href="#footnote47c"
class="citation">[47c]</a> and what Judgement more dreadfull can
a fool be given up to, than to be delivered into the hands of
such men, that have skill to do nothing, but to ripen sin, and
hasten its finishing unto damnation?&nbsp; And therefore men
should be afraid of offending God, because he can in this manner
punish them for their sins.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>I knew a man that once was, as I thought, hopefully awakened
about his Condition; yea, I knew two that were so awakened; but
in time they began to draw back, and to incline again to their
lusts; wherefore, God gave them up to the company of three or
four men, that in less than three years time brought them roundly
to the Gallows, where they were hanged like Dogs, because they
refused to live like honest men. <a name="citation47e"></a><a
href="#footnote47e" class="citation">[47e]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But such men do not believe, that thus to be
given up of God, is in Judgement and anger; they rather take it
to be their liberty, and do count it their happiness; they are
glad that their Cord is loosed, and that the reins are in their
neck; they are glad that they may sin without controul, and that
they may choose such company as can make them more expert in an
evil way.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Their Judgement is therefore so much the greater,
because thereto is added blindness of Mind, and hardness of Heart
in a wicked way.&nbsp; They are turned up to the way of Death,
but must not see to what place they are going: They must go as
the Ox to the slaughter, and as the Fool to the Correction of the
Stocks, <a name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a"
class="citation">[48a]</a> till a Dart strikes through their
Liver, not knowing that it is for their life.&nbsp; This, I say,
makes their Judgement double, they are given up of God, for a
while to sport themselves with that which will assuredly make
them mourn at last, when their flesh and their body is consumed.
<a name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a>&nbsp; These are those that Peter <a
name="citation48c"></a><a href="#footnote48c"
class="citation">[48c]</a> speaks of, that shall utterly perish
in their own corruptions; these, I say, who count it pleasure to
ryot in the day-time, and that sport themselves with their own
deceivings, are, as natural bruit beasts, made to be taken and
destroyed.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but I pray now concerning these three
Villains that were young Badmans companions: Tell me more
particularly how he carried it then.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; How he carried it! why, he did as they.&nbsp; I
intimated so much before, when I said, they made him an arch, a
chief one in their ways.</p>
<p>First, He became a Frequenter of <a name="citation48d"></a><a
href="#footnote48d" class="citation">[48d]</a> Taverns and
Tippling-houses, and would stay there untill he was even as drunk
as a Beast.&nbsp; And if it was so, that he could not get out by
day, he would, be sure, get out by night.&nbsp; Yea, he became so
common a Drunkard, at last, that he was taken notice of to be a
Drunkard even by all.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This was Swinish, for Drunkenness, is so beastly
a sin, a sin so much against Nature, that I wonder that any that
have but the appearance of Men, can give up themselves to so
beastly (yea, worse than beastly) a thing.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It is a Swinish vanity indeed.&nbsp; I will tell
you another Story. <a name="citation48f"></a><a
href="#footnote48f" class="citation">[48f]</a>&nbsp; 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>There was a Gentleman that had a Drunkard to be his Groom,
and coming home one night very much abused with Beer, his Master
saw it.&nbsp; Well (quoth his Master within himself,) I will let
thee alone to night, but to morrow morning I will convince thee
that thou art worse than a Beast, by the behaviour of my
Horse.&nbsp; So when morning was come, he bids his man goe and
water his Horse, and so he did; but coming up to his Master, he
commands him to water him again; so the fellow rid into the water
the second time, but his masters horse would now drink no more,
so the fellow came up and told his Master.&nbsp; Then said his
Master, Thou drunken sot, thou art far worse than my Horse, he
will drink but to satisfie nature, but thou wilt drink to the
abuse of nature; he will drink but to refresh himself, but thou
to thy hurt and dammage; He will drink, that he may be more
serviceable to his Master, but thou, till thou art uncapable of
serving either God or Man.&nbsp; O thou Beast, how much art thou
worse than the horse that thou ridest on.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Truly I think that his Master served him right;
for in doing as he did, he shewed him plainly, as he said, that
he had not so much government of himself as his horse had of
himself, and consequently that his beast did live more according
to the Law of his nature by far, than did his man.&nbsp; But pray
go on with what you have further to say.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why, I say, that there are <a
name="citation49a"></a><a href="#footnote49a"
class="citation">[49a]</a> four things, which if they were well
considered, would make drunkenness to be abhorred in the thoughts
of the Children of men.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; It greatly tendeth to impoverish and beggar a
man.&nbsp; The Drunkard, says Solomon, shall come to poverty. <a
name="citation49b"></a><a href="#footnote49b"
class="citation">[49b]</a>&nbsp; Many that have begun the world
with Plenty, have gone out of it in Rags; through
drunkenness.&nbsp; Yea, many Children that have been born to good
Estates, have yet been brought to a Flail &amp; a Rake, through
this beastly sin of their Parents.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; This sin of Drunkenness, it bringeth upon the Body,
many, great, and incurable Diseases, by which Men do in little
time come to their end, and none can help them.&nbsp; So, because
they are overmuch wicked, therefore they dye before their time.
<a name="citation49c"></a><a href="#footnote49c"
class="citation">[49c]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Drunkenness, is a sin that is often times attended
with abundance of other evils.&nbsp; Who hath woe?&nbsp; Who hath
sorrow?&nbsp; Who hath contention?&nbsp; Who hath
babblings?&nbsp; Who hath wounds without cause?&nbsp; Who hath
redness of the eyes?&nbsp; They that tarry long at the Wine, they
that go to seek mixt wine. <a name="citation49d"></a><a
href="#footnote49d" class="citation">[49d]</a>&nbsp; That is, the
Drunkard.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; By Drunkenness, Men do often times shorten their
dayes; goe out of the Ale-house drunk, and break their Necks
before they come home.&nbsp; Instances not a few might be given
of this, but this is so manifest, a man need say nothing.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But <a name="citation50a"></a><a
href="#footnote50a" class="citation">[50a]</a> <a
name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"
class="citation">[50b]</a> that which is worse than all is, it
also prepares men for everlasting burnings.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yea, and it so stupifies and besotts the soul,
that a man that is far gone in Drunkenness, is hardly ever
recovered to God.&nbsp; Tell me, when did you see an old drunkard
converted?&nbsp; No, no, such an one will sleep till he dies,
though he sleeps on the top of a <a name="citation50c"></a><a
href="#footnote50c" class="citation">[50c]</a> Mast, let his
dangers be never so great and Death and damnation never so near,
he will not be awaked out of his sleep.&nbsp; So that if a man
have any respect either to Credit, Health, Life or Salvation, he
will not be a drunken man.&nbsp; But the truth is, where this sin
gets the upper hand, men are, as I said before, so intoxicated
and bewitched with the seeming pleasures, and sweetness thereof;
that they have neither heart nor mind to think of that which is
better in itself; and would, if imbraced, do them good.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; You said that drunkenness tends to poverty, yet
some make themselves rich by drunken bargains.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I <a name="citation50d"></a><a href="#footnote50d"
class="citation">[50d]</a> said so, because the Word says
so.&nbsp; And as to some mens getting thereby, that is indeed but
rare, and base: yea, and base will be the end of such
gettings.&nbsp; The Word of God is against such wayes, and the
curse of God will be the end of such doings.&nbsp; An Inheritance
may sometimes thus be hastily gotten at the beginning, but the
end thereof shall not be blessed.&nbsp; Hark what the Prophet
saith; Wo to him that coveteth an evil covetousness, that he may
set his nest on high. <a name="citation50e"></a><a
href="#footnote50e" class="citation">[50e]</a>&nbsp; Whether he
makes drunkenness, or ought else, the engine and decoy to get it;
for that man doth but consult the shame of his own house, the
spoiling of his family, and the damnation of his Soul; for that
which he getteth by working of iniquity, is but a getting by the
devices of Hell; Therefore he can be no gainer neither for
himself or family, that gains by an evil course.&nbsp; But this
was one of the sins that Mr. Badman was addicted to after he came
acquainted with these three fellows, nor could all that his
Master could do break him of this Beastly sin.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But where, since he was but an Apprentice, could
he get Money to follow this practice, for drunkenness, as you
have intimated, is a very costly sin.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; His Master <a name="citation51a"></a><a
href="#footnote51a" class="citation">[51a]</a> paid for
all.&nbsp; For, (as I told you before) as he learned of these
three Villains to be a Beastly Drunkard; so he learned of them to
pilfer and steal from his Master.&nbsp; Sometimes he would sell
off his Masters Goods, but keep the Money, that is when he could;
also sometimes he would beguile his Master by taking out of his
Cashbox: and when he could do neither of these, he would convey
away of his Masters wares, what he thought would be least missed,
and send or carry them to such and such houses, where he knew
they would be laid up to his use, and then appoint set times
there, to meet and make merry with these fellowes.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This, was as bad, nay, I think, worse than the
former; for by thus doing, he did, not only run himself under the
wrath of God, but has endangered the undoing of his Master and
his Familie.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Sins go not alone, but follow one the other as do
the links of a Chain; he that will be a drunkard, must have money
either of his own, or of some other mans; either of his Fathers,
Mothers, Masters, or at the high-way, or some way.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I fear that many an honest man is undone by such
kind of servants.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I am of the same mind with you, but <a
name="citation51b"></a><a href="#footnote51b"
class="citation">[51b]</a> this should make the dealer the more
wary what kind of Servants he keeps, and what kind of Apprentices
he takes.&nbsp; It should also teach him to look well to his Shop
himself, also to take strict account of all things that are
bought and sold by his Servants.&nbsp; The Masters neglect herein
may embolden his servant to be bad, and may bring him too in
short time to rags and a morsel of Bread.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I am afraid that there is much of this kind of
pilfering among servants in these bad dayes of ours.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Now, while it is in my mind, I will tell you a
story.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>When I was in prison, there came a woman to me that was under
a great deal of trouble.&nbsp; So I asked her (she being a
stranger to me) what she had to say to me.&nbsp; She said, she
was afraid she should be damned.&nbsp; I asked her the cause of
those fears.&nbsp; She told me that she had sometime since lived
with a Shop-keeper at Wellingborough, and had robbed his box in
the Shop several times of Money, to the value of more than now I
will say; and pray, says she, tell me what I shall do.&nbsp; I
told her, I would have her go to her Master, and make him
satisfaction: She said, she was afraid; I asked her why?&nbsp;
She said, she doubted he would hang her.&nbsp; I told her, that I
would intercede for her life, and would make use of other friends
too to do the like; But she told me, she durst not venture
that.&nbsp; Well, said I, shall I send to your Master, while you
abide out of sight, and make your peace with him, before he sees
you; and with that, I asked her her Masters name.&nbsp; But all
that she said in answer to this, was, Pray let it alone till I
come to you again.&nbsp; So away she went, and neither told me
her Masters Name, nor her own: This is about ten or twelve years
since, and I never saw her again.&nbsp; I tell you this story for
this cause; to confirm your fears, that such kind of servants too
many there be; and that God makes them sometimes like old Tod, of
whom mention was made before, (through the terrors that he layes
upon them) to betray themselves.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>I could tell you of another, that came to me with a like
relation concerning her self, and the robbing of her Mistress;
but at this time let this suffice.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But what was that other Villain addicted to, I
mean, young Badmans third companion?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Uncleanness. <a name="citation52b"></a><a
href="#footnote52b" class="citation">[52b]</a>&nbsp; I told you
before, but it seems you forgot.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Right, it was Uncleanness.&nbsp; Uncleanness is
also a filthy sin.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It is so; and yet it is one of the most reigning
sins in our day.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; So they say, and that too among those that one
would think had more wit, even among the great ones.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; The more is the pity: for usually Examples that
are set by them that are great and chief, <a
name="citation52c"></a><a href="#footnote52c"
class="citation">[52c]</a> spread sooner, and more universally,
then do the sins of other men; yea, and when such men are at the
head in transgressing, sin walks with a bold face through the
Land.&nbsp; As Jeremiah saith of the Prophets, so may it be said
of such, From them is profaneness gone forth into all the land;
that is, with bold and audacious face, Jer. 23.&nbsp; 15.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But pray let us return again to Mr. Badman and
his companions.&nbsp; You say one of them was very vile in the
commission of Uncleanness.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes, so I say; not but that he was a Drunkard and
also Thievish, but he was most arch in this sin of Uncleanness:
This Roguery was his Master-piece, for he was a Ringleader to
them all in the beastly sin of Whoredom.&nbsp; He was also best
acquainted with such houses where they were, and so could readily
lead the rest of his Gang unto them.&nbsp; The Strumpets also,
because they knew this young Villain, would at first discover
themselves in all their whorish pranks to those that he brought
with him.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; That is a deadly thing: I mean, it is a deadly
thing to young men, when such beastly queans, shall, with words
and carriages that are openly tempting, discover themselves unto
them; It is hard for such to escape their Snare.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; That is true, therefore the Wise mans counsel is
the best: Come not near the door of her house; <a
name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a"
class="citation">[53a]</a> for they are (as you say) very
tempting, as is seen by her in the Proverbs.&nbsp; I looked (says
the Wise man) through my casement, and beheld among the simple
ones, I discerned a young man void of understanding, passing
through the streets near her corner, and he went the way to her
house: In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark
night.&nbsp; And behold, there met him a Woman, with the attire
of an harlot, and subtle of heart; (<a name="citation53c"></a><a
href="#footnote53c" class="citation">[53c]</a> she is loud and
stubborn, her feet abide not in her house.&nbsp; Now she is
without, now she is in the street, and lieth in wait at every
corner.)&nbsp; So she caught him, and kiss&rsquo;d him, and with
an impudent face said unto him: I have peace offerings with me;
this day have I payed my vows.&nbsp; Therefore came I forth to
meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found
thee.&nbsp; I have decked my bed with coverings of Tapestry, with
carved works, with fine Linnen of &AElig;gypt: I have perfumed my
bed with Myrrhe, Aloes, and Cinnamon; come let us take our fill
of love untill the Morning, let us solace our selves with loves.
<a name="citation53b"></a><a href="#footnote53b"
class="citation">[53b]</a>&nbsp; Here was a bold Beast: And
indeed, the very eyes, hands, words and ways of such, are all
snares and bands to youthful, lustful fellows: And with these was
young Badman greatly snared.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This sin of Uncleanness <a
name="citation54a"></a><a href="#footnote54a"
class="citation">[54a]</a> is mightily cried out against both by
Moses, the Prophets, Christ, and his Apostles; and yet, as we
see, for all that, how men run head-long to it!</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You have said the truth, and I will adde, that
God, to hold men back from so filthy a sin, has set such a stamp
of his Indignation upon it, and commanded such evil effects to
follow it, that were not they that use it bereft of all Fear of
God, and love to their own health, they could not but stop and be
afraid to commit it.&nbsp; For, besides the eternal Damnation
that doth attend such in the next world, (for these have no
Inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God, Ephes. 5.) the
evil effects thereof in this world are dreadfull.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray skew me some of them, that as occasion
offereth it self, I may shew them to others for their good.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; So I will.&nbsp; 1. <a name="citation54b"></a><a
href="#footnote54b" class="citation">[54b]</a> It bringeth a man
(as was said of the sin before) to want and poverty; for by means
of a Whorish woman, a man is brought to a piece of bread.&nbsp;
The reason is, for that an Whore will not yield without hire; and
men when the Devil and Lust is in them, and God and his Fear far
away from them, will not stick, so they may accomplish their
desire, to lay their Signet, their Bracelets, and their Staff to
pledge, <a name="citation54c"></a><a href="#footnote54c"
class="citation">[54c]</a> rather than miss of the fulfilling of
their lusts.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Again, by this sin men diminish their
strength, and bring upon themselves, even upon the Body, a
multitude of Diseases.&nbsp; This King Lemuel&rsquo;s Mother
warned him of.&nbsp; What my Son, said she, and what the son of
my womb, and what the Son of my Vows: Give not thy strength unto
women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth Kings. <a
name="citation54d"></a><a href="#footnote54d"
class="citation">[54d]</a> This sin is destructive to the
Body.&nbsp; Give me leave to tell you another story.&nbsp;

</a>I <a name="citation54f"></a><a href="#footnote54f"
class="citation">[54f]</a> have heard of a great man that was a
very unclean person, and he had lived so long in that sin, that
he had almost lost his sight.&nbsp; So his Physicians were sent
for, to whom he told his to Disease; but they told him, that they
could do him no good, unless he would forbear his Women.&nbsp;
Nay then, said he, farewell sweet Sight.&nbsp; Whence observe,
that this sin, as I said, is destructive to the Body; and also,
that some men be so in love therewith, that they will have it,
though it destroy their body.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Paul says also, that he that sins this sin, sins
against his own Body.&nbsp; But what of that? he that will run
the hazard of eternal Damnation of his Soul, but he will commit
this sin, will for it run the hazard of destroying his
Body.&nbsp; If young Badman feared not the Damnation of his Soul,
do you think that the consideration of impairing of his Body,
would have deterred him therefrom?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You say true.&nbsp; But yet, methinks, there are
still such bad effects follow, often, upon the commission of it,
that if men would consider them, it would put, at least, a stop
to their career therein.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; What other evil effects attend this sin?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Outward shame and disgrace, and that in these
particulars: <a name="citation55a"></a><a href="#footnote55a"
class="citation">[55a]</a></p>
<p>First, There often follows this foul sin, the Foul Disease,
now called by us the Pox.&nbsp; A disease so nauseous and
stinking, so infectious to the whole body (and so intailed to
this sin) that hardly are any common with unclean Women, but they
have more or less a touch of it to their shame.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; That is a foul disease indeed: 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>I knew a man once that rotted away with it; and another that
had his Nose eaten off, and his Mouth almost quite sewed up
thereby.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It is a Disease, that where it is, it commonly
declares, that the cause thereof is Uncleanness.&nbsp; It
declares to all that behold such a man, that he is an odious, a
beastly, unclean person.&nbsp; This is that strange punishment
that Job speaks of, that is appointed to seize on these workers
of Iniquity. <a name="citation55c"></a><a href="#footnote55c"
class="citation">[55c]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Then it seems you think that the strange
punishment that Job there speaks of, should be the foul
disease.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I have thought so indeed, and that for this
reason: We see that this Disease is entailed as I may say, to
this most beastly sin, nor is there any disease so entailed to
any other sin, as this to this.&nbsp; That this is the sin to
which the strange Punishment is entailed, you will easily
perceive when you read the Text.&nbsp; I made a covenant with
mine eyes, said Job, why should I think upon a Maid?&nbsp; For
what portion is there (for that sin) from above, and what
Inheritance of the Almighty from on high?&nbsp; And then he
answers himself; Is not destruction to the wicked, and a strange
punishment to the workers of iniquity?&nbsp; This strange
Punishment is the Pox.</p>
<p>Also I think that this foul Disease is that which Solomon
intends, when he saith, (speaking of this unclean and beastly
creature) A wound and dishonour shall he get, and his reproach
shall not be turned away. <a name="citation56"></a><a
href="#footnote56" class="citation">[56]</a>&nbsp; A Punishment
Job calls it, a Wound and Dishonour, Solomon calls it; and they
both do set it as a Remark upon this sin; Job calling it a
strange punishment, and Solomon a reproach that shall not be
turned away from them that are common in it.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; What other things follow upon the commission of
this beastly sin?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why, often-times it is attended with Murder, with
the murder of the Babe begotten on the defiled bed.&nbsp; How
common it is for the Bastard-getter and Bastard-bearer, to
consent together to murder their Children, will be better known
at the day of Judgement; yet something is manifest now.</p>
<p>I will tell you another story.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"

"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>An ancient man, one of mine acquaintance, a man of good
credit in our Countrey, had a Mother that was a Midwife: who was
mostly imployed in laying great persons.&nbsp; To this womans
house, upon a time, comes a brave young Gallant on horseback, to
fetch her to lay a young Lady.&nbsp; So she addresses herself to
go with him; wherefore, he takes her up behind him, and away they
ride in the night.&nbsp; Now they had not rid far, but the
Gentleman litt off his horse, and taking the old Midwife in his
arms from the horse, turned round with her several times, and
then set her up again; then he got up, and away they went till
they came at a stately house, into which he had her, and so into
a Chamber where the young Lady was in her pains: He then bid the
Midwife do her Office, and she demanded help, but he drew out his
Sword and told her, if she did not make speed to do her Office
without, she must look for nothing but death.&nbsp; Well, to be
short, this old Midwife laid the young Lady, and a fine sweet
Babe she had; Now there was made in a Room hard by, a very great
Fire: so the Gentleman took up the Babe, went and drew the coals
from the stock, cast the Child in, and covered it up, and there
was an end of that.&nbsp; So when the Midwife had done her work,
he paid her well for her pains, but shut her up in a dark room
all day, and when night came, took her up behind him again, and
carried her away, till she came almost at home; then he turned
her round, and round, as he did before, and had her to her house,
set her down, bid her Farewell, and away he went: And she could
never tell who it was.</p>
<p>This Story the Midwifes son, who was a Minister, told me; and
also protested that his mother told it him for a truth.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Murder doth often follow indeed, as that which is
the fruit of this sin: but sometimes God brings even these
Adulterers, and Adulteresses to shameful ends.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"

src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>I heard of one, (I think, a Doctor of Physick) and his Whore,
who had had three or four Bastards betwixt them, and had murdered
them all, but at last themselves were hanged for it, in or near
to Colchester.&nbsp; It came out after this manner: The Whore was
so afflicted in her conscience abort it, that she could not be
quiet untill she had made it known: Thus God many times makes the
actors of wickedness their own accusers, and brings them by their
own tongues to condigne punishment for their own sins.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; There has been many such instances, but we will
let that pass.&nbsp; I was once in the presence of a Woman, a
married woman, that lay sick of the sickness whereof she died;
and being smitten in her conscience for the sin of Uncleanness,
which she had often committed with other men, 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>I heard her (as she lay upon her Bed) cry out thus: I am a
Whore, and all my Children are Bastards: And I must go to Hell
for my sin; and look, there stands the Devil at my beds feet to
receive my Soul when I die.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; These are sad storyes, tell no more of them now,
but if you please shew me yet some other of the evil effects of
this beastly sin.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; This sin is such a snare to the Soul, that unless
a miracle of Grace prevents, it unavoidably perishes in the
enchanting and bewitching pleasures of it.&nbsp; This is manifest
by these, and such like Texts.</p>
<p>The Adulteress will hunt for the precious life.&nbsp; Whoso
committeth adultery with a woman, lacketh understanding, and he
that doth it destroys his own soul. <a name="citation57"></a><a
href="#footnote57" class="citation">[57]</a>&nbsp; An Whore is a
deep ditch, and a strange woman is a narrow pit.&nbsp; Her house
inclines to death, and her pathes unto the dead.&nbsp; None that
go in unto her return again, neither take they hold of the path
of life.&nbsp; She hath cast down many wounded; yea many strong
men have been slain by her, her house is the way to Hell, going
down to the Chambers of Death. <a name="citation58a"></a><a
href="#footnote58a" class="citation">[58a]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; These are dreadful sayings, and do shew the
dreadful state of those that are guilty of this sin.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Verily so they doe.&nbsp; But yet that which makes
the whole more dreadful, is, That men are given up to this sin,
because they are abhorred of God, and because abhorred, therefore
they shall fall into the commission of it; and shall live
there.&nbsp; The mouth (that is, the flattering Lips) of a
strange woman is a deep pit, the abhorred of the Lord shall fall
therein. <a name="citation58b"></a><a href="#footnote58b"
class="citation">[58b]</a>&nbsp; Therefore it saith again of
such, that they have none Inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ
and of God. <a name="citation58c"></a><a href="#footnote58c"
class="citation">[58c]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Put all together, and it is a dreadful thing to
live and die in this transgression.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; True.&nbsp; But suppose, that instead of all these
Judgments, this sin had attending of it all the felicities of
this life, and no bitterness, shame, or disgrace mixed with it,
yet one hour in Hell will spoil all.&nbsp; O! this Hell,
Hell-fire, Damnation in Hell, it is such an inconceivable
punishment, that were it but throughly believed, it would nip
this sin, with others, in the head.&nbsp; But here is the
mischief, those that give up themselves to these things, do so
harden themselves in Unbelief and Atheism about the things, the
punishments that God hath threatned to inflict upon the
committers of them, that at last they arrive to, almost, an
absolute and firm belief that there is no Judgment to come
hereafter: Else they would not, they could not, no not attempt to
commit this sin, by such abominable language as some do.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"

"Take note symbol"

</a>I heard of one that should say to his Miss, when he tempted
her to the committing of this sin, If thou wilt venture thy Body,
I will venture my Soul. <a name="citation58d"></a><a
href="#footnote58d" class="citation">[58d]</a>&nbsp; And I my
self heard another say, when he was tempting of a Maid to commit
uncleanness with him, (it was in Olivers dayes) That if she did
prove with Child, he would tell her how she might escape
punishment, (and that was then somewhat severe,) Say (saith he)
when you come before the Judge, That you are with Child by the
Holy Ghost.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>I heard him say thus, and it greatly afflicted me; I had a
mind to have accused him for it before some Magistrate; but he
was a great man, and I was poor, and young: so I let it alone,
but it troubled me very much.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the most horrible thing that ever I
heard in my life.&nbsp; But how far off are these men from that
Spirit and Grace that dwelt in Joseph!</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Right; when Joseph&rsquo;s Mistress tempted him,
yea tempted him daily; <a name="citation59b"></a><a
href="#footnote59b" class="citation">[59b]</a> yea, she laid hold
on him, and said with her Whores forehead, Come lie with me, but
he refused: He hearkned not to lie with her, or to be with
her.&nbsp; Mr. Badman would have taken the opportunity.</p>
<p>And a little to comment upon this of Joseph. <a
name="citation59c"></a><a href="#footnote59c"
class="citation">[59c]</a></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Here is a Miss, a great Miss, the Wife of the Captain
of the Guard, some beautiful Dame, I&rsquo;le warrant you.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Here is a Miss won, and in her whorish Affections
come over to Joseph, without his speaking of a word.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Here is her unclean Desire made known; Come lie with
me, said she.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Here was a fit opportunity.&nbsp; There was none of
the men of the house there within.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Joseph was a young man, full of strength, and
therefore the more in danger to be taken.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; This was to him, a Temptation, from her, that lasted
days.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; And yet Joseph refused, 1.&nbsp; Her daily
Temptation; 2.&nbsp; Her daily Solicitation: 3.&nbsp; Her daily
Provocation, heartily, violently and constantly.&nbsp; For when
she caught him by the Garment, saying, Lie with me, he left his
Garment in her hand, and gat him out.&nbsp; Ay, and although
contempt, treachery, slander, accusation, imprisonment, and
danger of death followed, (for an Whore careth not what mischief
she does, when she cannot have her end) yet Joseph will not
defile himself, sin against God, and hazard his own eternal
salvation.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Blessed Joseph!&nbsp; I would thou hadst more
fellows!</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Mr. Badman has more fellows than Joseph, else
there would not be so many Whores as there are: For though I
doubt not but that that Sex is bad enough this way, yet I verify
believe that many of them are made Whores at first by the
flatteries of Badmans fellows.&nbsp; Alas! there is many a woman
plunged into this sin at first even by promises of Marriage. <a
name="citation60a"></a><a href="#footnote60a"
class="citation">[60a]</a>&nbsp; I say, by these promises they
are flattered, yea, forced into a consenting to these Villanies,
and so being in, and growing hardened in their hearts, they at
last give themselves up, even as wicked men do, to act this kind
of wickedness with greediness.&nbsp; But Joseph you see, was of
another mind, for the Fear of God was in him.</p>
<p>I will, before I leave this, tell you here two notable
storyes; and I wish Mr. Badmans companions may hear of
them.&nbsp; They are found in Clarks Looking-glass for Sinners;
and are these.</p>
<p>Mr. Cleaver (says Mr. Clark) reports of one whom he knew, that
had committed the act of Uncleanness, whereupon he fell into such
horror of Conscience that he hanged himself; leaving it thus
written in a paper. Indeed, (saith he) I acknowledge it to be
utterly unlawful for a man to kill himself, but I am bound to act
the Magistrates part, because the punishment of this sin is
death. <a name="citation60b"></a><a href="#footnote60b"
class="citation">[60b]</a></p>
<p>Clark doth also in the same page make mention of two more, who
as they were committing Adultery in London, were immediately
struck dead with fire from Heaven, in the very Act.&nbsp; Their
bodyes were so found, half burnt up, and sending out a most
loathsom savour.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; These are notable storyes indeed.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; So they are, and I suppose they are as true as
notable.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but I wonder, if young Badmans Master knew
him to be such a Wretch, that he would suffer him in his
house.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; They liked one another even as <a
name="citation60c"></a><a href="#footnote60c"
class="citation">[60c]</a> fire and water doe.&nbsp; Young
Badmans wayes were odious to his Master, and his Masters wayes
were such as young Badman could not endure.&nbsp; Thus in these
two, was fulfilled that saying of the Holy Ghost: An unjust man
is an abomination to the just, and he that is upright in the way
is abomination to the wicked. <a name="citation60d"></a><a
href="#footnote60d" class="citation">[60d]</a></p>
<p>The good mans wayes, Mr. Badman could not abide, nor could the
good man abide the bad wayes of his base Apprentice.&nbsp; Yet
would his Master, if he could, have kept him, and also have
learnt him his trade.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; If he could! why he might, if he would, might he
not?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Alas, Badman ran away <a name="citation61a"></a><a
href="#footnote61a" class="citation">[61a]</a> from him once and
twice, and would not at all be ruled.&nbsp; So the next time he
did run away from him, he did let him go indeed.&nbsp; For he
gave him no occasion to run away, except it was by holding of him
as much as he could (and that he could do but little) to good and
honest rules of life.&nbsp; And had it been ones own case, one
should have let him go.&nbsp; For what should a man do, that had
either regard to his own Peace, his Childrens Good, or the
preservation of the rest of his servants from evil, but let him
go?&nbsp; Had he staid, the house of Correction had been most fit
for him, but thither his Master was loth to send him, because of
the love that he bore to his Father.&nbsp; An house of
correction, I say, had been the fittest place for him, but his
Master let him go.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; He ran away you say, but whither did he run?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why, to one of his own trade, <a
name="citation61b"></a><a href="#footnote61b"
class="citation">[61b]</a> and also like himself.&nbsp; Thus the
wicked joyned hand in hand, and there he served out his time.</p>
<p>Atten. Then, sure, he had his hearts desire, when he was with
one so like himself.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; So he had, but God gave it him in his
anger.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; How do you mean?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I mean as before, that for a wicked man to be by
the Providence of God, turned out of a good mans doors, into a
wicked mans house to dwell, is a sign of the Anger of God. <a
name="citation61c"></a><a href="#footnote61c"
class="citation">[61c]</a>&nbsp; For God by this, and such
Judgements, says thus to such an one: Thou wicked one, thou
lovest not me, my wayes, nor my people; Thou castest my Law and
good Counsel behinde thy back: Come, I will dispose of thee in my
wrath; thou shalt be turned over to the ungodly, thou shalt be
put to school to the Devil, I will leave thee to sink and swim in
sin, till I shall visit thee with Death and Judgment.&nbsp; This
was therefore another Judgment that did come upon this young
Badman.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; You have said the truth, for God by such a
Judgment as this, in effect says so indeed; for he takes them out
of the hand of the just, and binds them up in the hand of the
wicked, and whither they then shall be carried, a man may easily
imagin.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It is one of the saddest tokens of Gods anger that
happens to such kind of persons: And that for several reasons. <a
name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Such an one, by this Judgment, is put out out of the
way, and from under the means which ordinarily are made use of to
do good to the soul.&nbsp; For a Family where Godliness is
professed, and practised, is Gods Ordinance, the place which he
has appointed to teach young ones the way and fear of God. <a
name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b"
class="citation">[62b]</a>&nbsp; Now to be put out of such a
Family into a bad, a wicked one, as Mr. Badman was, must needs be
in Judgment, and a sign of the anger of God.&nbsp; For in ungodly
Families men learn to forget God, to hate goodness, and to
estrange themselves from the wayes of those that are good.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In Bad Families, they have continually fresh
Examples, and also incitements to evil, and fresh encouragements
to it too.&nbsp; Yea moreover, in such places evil is commended,
praised, well-spoken of, and they that do it, are applauded; and
this, to be sure, is a drowning Judgement.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Such places are the very haunts and Walks of the
infernal Spirits, who are continually poysoning the Cogitations
and Minds of one or other in such Families, that they may be able
to poyson others.&nbsp; Therefore observe it, usually in wicked
Families, some one, or two, are more arch for wickedness then are
any other that are there.&nbsp; Now such are Satans
Conduit-pipes; for by them he conveighs of the spawn of Hell,
through their being crafty in wickedness, into the Ears and Souls
of their Companions.&nbsp; Yea, and when they have once conceived
wickedness, they travel with it, as doth a woman with Child, till
they have brought it forth; Behold, he travelleth with iniquity,
and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falshood. <a
name="citation62c"></a><a href="#footnote62c"
class="citation">[62c]</a>&nbsp; Some men, as here is intimated
in the Text, and as was hinted also before, have a kind of
mystical, but hellish copulation with the Devil, who is the
Father, and their Soul the Mother of sin and wickedness; and
they, so soon as they have conceived by him, finish, by bringing
forth sin, both it, and their own damnation. <a
name="citation62d"></a><a href="#footnote62d"
class="citation">[62d]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; How <a name="citation63a"></a><a
href="#footnote63a" class="citation">[63a]</a> much then doth it
concern those Parents that love their Children, to see, that if
they go from them, they be put into such Families as be good,
that they may learn there betimes to eschew evil, and to follow
that which is good?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It doth concern them indeed; and it doth also
concern them <a name="citation63b"></a><a href="#footnote63b"
class="citation">[63b]</a> that take Children into their
Families, to take heed what Children they receive.&nbsp; For a
man may soon by a Bad boy, be dammaged both in his Name, Estate,
and Family, and also hindred in his Peace and peaceable pursuit
after God and godliness; I say, by one such Vermin as a wicked
and filthy Apprentice.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; True, for one Sinner destroyeth much good, and a
poor man is better than a Lier.&nbsp; But many times a man cannot
help it; for such as at the beginning promise very fair, are by a
little time proved to be very Rogues, like young Badman.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; That is true also, but when a man has done the
best he can to help it, he may with the more confidence expect
the Blessing of God to follow, or he shall have the more peace,
if things go contrary to his desire.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but did Mr. Badman and his Master agree so
well?&nbsp; I mean his last Master, since they were Birds of a
Feather, I mean, since they were so well met for wickedness.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; This second Master, was, as before I told you, bad
enough, but yet he would often fall out <a
name="citation63c"></a><a href="#footnote63c"
class="citation">[63c]</a> with young Badman his Servant, and
chide, yea and some times beat him too, for his naughty
doings.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; What! for all he was so bad himself!&nbsp; This
is like the Proverb, The Devil corrects Vice.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I will assure you, &rsquo;tis as I say.&nbsp; For
you must know, that Badmans wayes suited not with his Masters
gains.&nbsp; Could he have done as the Damsel that we read of
Acts 16. <a name="citation63d"></a><a href="#footnote63d"
class="citation">[63d]</a> did, to wit, fill his Masters Purse
with his badness, he had certainly been his White-boy, but it was
not so with young Badman; and therefore, though his Master and he
did suit well enough in the main, yet in this and that point they
differed.&nbsp; Young Badman <a name="citation63e"></a><a
href="#footnote63e" class="citation">[63e]</a> was for neglecting
of his Masters business, for going to the Whore-house, for
beguiling of his Master, for attempting to debauch his Daughters,
and the like: No marvel then if they disagreed in these
points.&nbsp; Not so much for that his Master had an antipathy
against the fact it self, for he could do so when he was an
Apprentice; but for that his servant by his sin made spoil of his
Commodities, &amp;c. and so damnified his Master.</p>
<p>Had (as I said before) young Badmans wickedness, had only a
tendency to his Masters advantage; as could he have sworn, lied,
cousened, cheated, and defrauded customers for his Master, (and
indeed sometimes he did so) but had that been all that he had
done, he had not had, no not a wry word from his Master: But this
was not always Mr. Badmans way.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; That was well brought in, even the Maid that we
read of in the Acts, and the distinction was as clear betwixt the
wickedness, and wickedness of servants.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Alas! men that are wicked themselves, yet greatly
hate it in others, not simply because it is wickedness, but
because it opposeth their interest.&nbsp; Do you think that that
Maids master would have been troubled at the loss of her, if he
had not lost, with her, his gain: No, I&rsquo;le warrant you; she
might have gone to the Devil for him: But when her master saw
that the hope of his gain was gone, then, then he fell to
persecuting Paul. <a name="citation64a"></a><a
href="#footnote64a" class="citation">[64a]</a>&nbsp; But Mr.
Badmans master did sometimes lose by Mr. Badmans sins, and then
Badman and his master were at odds.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Alas poor Badman!&nbsp; Then it seems thou
couldest not at all times please thy like.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; No, he could not, and the reason I have told
you.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But do not bad Masters condemn themselves in
condemning the badness of their servants. <a
name="citation64b"></a><a href="#footnote64b"
class="citation">[64b]</a></p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes; <a name="citation64c"></a><a
href="#footnote64c" class="citation">[64c]</a> in that they
condemn that in another which they either have, or do allow in
themselves.&nbsp; And the time will come, when that very sentence
that hath gone out of their own mouths against the sins of
others, themselves living and taking pleasure in the same, shall
return with violence upon their own pates.&nbsp; The Lord
pronounced Judgment against Baasha, as for all his evils in
general, so for this in special, because he was like the house of
Jeroboam, and yet killed him. <a name="citation64d"></a><a
href="#footnote64d" class="citation">[64d]</a>&nbsp; This is Mr.
Badmans Masters case, he is like his man, and yet he beats
him.&nbsp; He is like his man, and yet he rails at him for being
bad.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But why did not young Badman run away from this
Master, as he ran away from the other?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; He did not.&nbsp; And if I be not mistaken, the
reason <a name="citation65a"></a><a href="#footnote65a"
class="citation">[65a]</a> why, was this.&nbsp; There was
Godliness in the house of the first, and that young Badman could
not endure.&nbsp; For fare, for lodging, for work, and time, he
had better, and more by this Masters allowance, than ever he had
by his last; but all this would not content, because Godliness
was promoted there.&nbsp; He could not abide this praying, this
reading of Scriptures, and hearing, and repeating of Sermons: he
could not abide to be told of his transgressions in a sober and
Godly manner.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; There is a great deal in the Manner of reproof,
wicked men both can, and cannot abide to hear their
transgressions spoken against.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; There is a great deal of difference indeed.&nbsp;
This last Master of Mr. Badmans, would tell Mr. Badman of his
sins in Mr. Badmans own dialect; he would swear, and curse, and
damn, when he told him of his sins, and this he could bear
better, <a name="citation65b"></a><a href="#footnote65b"
class="citation">[65b]</a> than to be told of them after a godly
sort.&nbsp; Besides, that last Master would, when his passions
and rage was over, laugh at and make merry with the sins of his
servant Badman: And that would please young Badman well.&nbsp;
Nothing offended Badman but blows, and those he had but few of
now, because he was pretty well grown up.&nbsp; For the most part
when his Master did rage and swear, he would give him Oath for
Oath, and Curse for Curse, at least secretly, let him go on as
long as he would.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This was hellish living.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas hellish living indeed: And a man might
say, that with this Master, young Badman compleated himself <a
name="citation65c"></a><a href="#footnote65c"
class="citation">[65c]</a> yet more and more in wickedness, as
well as in his trade: for by that he came out of his time, what
with his own inclination to sin, what with his acquaintance with
his three companions, and what with this last Master, and the
wickedness he saw in him; he became a sinner in grain.&nbsp; I
think he had a Bastard laid to his charge before he came out of
his time.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but it seems he did live to come out of his
time, <a name="citation66a"></a><a href="#footnote66a"
class="citation">[66a]</a> but what did he then?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why, he went home to his Father, and he like a
loving and tender-hearted Father received him into his house.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; And how did he carry it there?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why, the reason why he went home, <a
name="citation66b"></a><a href="#footnote66b"
class="citation">[66b]</a> was, for Money to set up for himself,
he staied but a little at home, but that little while that he did
stay, he refrained himself <a name="citation66c"></a><a
href="#footnote66c" class="citation">[66c]</a> as well he could,
and did not so much discover himself to be base, for fear his
Father should take distaste, and so should refuse, or for a while
forbear to give him money.</p>
<p>Yet even then he would have his times, and companions, and the
fill of his lusts with them, but he used to blind all with this,
he was glad to see his old acquaintance, and they as glad to see
him, and he could not in civility but accomodate them with a
bottle or two of Wine, or a dozen or two of Drink.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; And did the old man give him money to set up
with?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes, above two hundred pounds.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Therein, I think, the old man was out.&nbsp; Had
I been his Father, I would have held him a little at staves-end,
till I had had far better proof of his manners to be good; (for I
perceive that his Father did know what a naughty boy he had been,
both by what he used to do at home, and because he changed a good
Master for a bad, &amp;c.)&nbsp; He should not therefore have
given him money so soon.&nbsp; What if he had pinched a little,
and gone to Journey-work for a time, that he might have known
what a penny was, by his earning of it?&nbsp; Then, in all
probability, he had known better how to have spent it: Yea, and
by that time perhaps, have better considered with himself, how to
have lived in the world.&nbsp; Ay, and who knows but he might
have come to himself with the Prodigal, and have asked God and
his Father forgiveness for the villanies that he had committed
against them. <a name="citation66d"></a><a href="#footnote66d"
class="citation">[66d]</a></p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; If his Father could also have blessed this manner
of dealing to him, and have made it effectual for the ends that
you have propounded; then I should have thought as you.&nbsp; But
alas, alas, you talk as if you never knew, or had at this present
forgot what the bowels and compassions of a Father are.&nbsp; Why
did you not serve your own son so?&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis evident
enough, that we are better at giving good counsel to others, than
we are at taking good counsel our selves. <a
name="citation67a"></a><a href="#footnote67a"
class="citation">[67a]</a>&nbsp; But mine honest neighbour,
suppose that Mr. Badmans Father had done as you say, and by so
doing had driven his son to ill courses, what had he bettered
either himself or his son in so doing?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true, but it doth not follow, that
if the Father had done as I said, the son would have done as you
suppose.&nbsp; But if he had done as you have supposed, what had
he done worse than what he hath done already? <a
name="citation67b"></a><a href="#footnote67b"
class="citation">[67b]</a></p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; He had done bad enough, that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp;
But suppose his Father had given him no Money, and suppose that
young Badman had taken a pett thereat, and in an anger had gone
beyond Sea, and his Father had neither seen him, nor heard of him
more.&nbsp; Or suppose that of a mad and headstrong stomach he
had gone to the High-way for money, and so had brought himself to
the Gallows, and his Father and Family to great contempt, or if
by so doing he had not brought himself to that end, yet he had
added to all his wickedness, such and such evils besides: And
what comfort could his Father have had in this?</p>
<p>Besides, when his Father had done for him what he could, with
desire to make him an honest man, he would then, whether his son
had proved honest or no, have laid down his head with far more
peace, than if he had taken your Counsel.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Nay I think I should not a been forward to have
given advice in the cause; but truly you have given me such an
account of his vilianies, that the hearing thereof has made me
angry with him.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; In an angry mood we may soon out-shoot our selves,
but poor wretch, as he is, he is gone to his place.&nbsp; But, as
I said, when a good Father hath done what he can for a bad Child,
and that Child shall prove never the better, he will lie down
with far more peace, than if through severity, he had driven him
to inconveniencies.</p>
<p>I remember that I have heard of a good woman, that had (as
this old man) a bad and ungodly <a name="citation68a"></a><a
href="#footnote68a" class="citation">[68a]</a> son, and she
prayed for him, counselled him, and carried it Motherly to him
for several years together; but still he remained bad.&nbsp; At
last, upon a time, after she had been at prayer, as she was wont,
for his conversion, she comes to him, and thus, or to this
effect, begins again to admonish him.&nbsp; Son, said she, Thou
hast been and art a wicked Child, thou hast cost me many a prayer
and tear, and yet thou remainest wicked.&nbsp; Well, I have done
my duty, I have done what I can to save thee; now I am satisfied,
that if I shall see thee damned at the day of Judgment, I shall
be so far off from being grieved for thee, that I shall rejoyce
to hear the sentence of thy damnation at that day: And it
converted him.</p>
<p>I tell you, that if Parents carry it lovingly towards their
Children, mixing their Mercies with loving Rebukes and their
loving Rebukes with Fatherly and Motherly Compassions, they are
more likely to save their Children, than by being churlish and
severe toward them: but if they do not save them, if their mercy
doth them no good, yet it will greatly ease them at the day of
death, to consider; I have done by love as much as I could, to
save and deliver my child from Hell.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well I yield.&nbsp; But pray let us return again
to Mr. Badman: You say, that his Father gave him a piece of money
that he might set up for himself.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes, his Father did give him a piece of money, and
he did set up, <a name="citation68b"></a><a href="#footnote68b"
class="citation">[68b]</a> and almost as soon set down again: for
he was not long set up, but by his ill managing of his matters at
home, together with his extravagant expences abroad, he was got
so far into debt, and had so little in his shop to pay, that he
was hard put to it to keep himself out of prison.&nbsp; But when
his Creditors understood that he was about to marry, and in a
fair way to get a rich Wife, they said among themselves, We will
not be hasty with him, if he gets a rich Wife he will pay us
all.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But how could he so quickly run out, for I
perceive &rsquo;twas in little time, by what you say?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas in little time indeed, I think he was
not above two years and a half in doing of it: but the reason <a
name="citation69a"></a><a href="#footnote69a"
class="citation">[69a]</a> is apparent; for he being a wild young
man, and now having the bridle loose before him, and being wholly
subjected to his lusts and vices, he gave himself up to the way
of his heart, and to the sight of his eye, forgetting that for
all these things God will bring him to Judgment; <a
name="citation69b"></a><a href="#footnote69b"
class="citation">[69b]</a> and he that doth thus, you may be
sure, shall not be able long to stand on his leggs.</p>
<p>Besides, he had now an addition of <a
name="citation69c"></a><a href="#footnote69c"
class="citation">[69c]</a> new companions; companions you must
think, most like himself in Manners, and so such that cared not
who sunk, if they themselves might swim.&nbsp; These would often
be haunting of him, and of his shop too when he was absent.&nbsp;
They would commonly egg him to the Ale-house, but yet make him
Jack-pay-for-all; They would be borrowing also money of him, but
take no care to pay again, except it was with more of their
company, which also he liked very well; and so his poverty came
like one that travelleth, and his want like an armed man.</p>
<p>But all the while they studied his temper; <a
name="citation69d"></a><a href="#footnote69d"
class="citation">[69d]</a> he loved to be flattered, praised and
commanded for Wit, Manhood, and Personage; and this was like
stroking him over the face.&nbsp; Thus they Collogued with him,
and got yet more and more into him, and so (like Horse-leaches)
they drew away that little that his father had given him, and
brought him quickly down, almost to dwell next dore to the
begger.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Then was the saying of the wise man fulfilled, He
that keepeth company with harlots, and a companion of fools,
shall be destroyed. <a name="citation69e"></a><a
href="#footnote69e" class="citation">[69e]</a></p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Ay, and that too, A companion of riotous persons
shameth his father; <a name="citation69f"></a><a
href="#footnote69f" class="citation">[69f]</a> For he, poor man,
had both grief and shame, to see how his son (now at his own
hand) behaved himself in the enjoyment of those good things, in
and under the lawfull use of which he might have lived to Gods
glory, his own comfort, and credit among his neighbours.&nbsp;
But he that followeth vain persons, shall have poverty enough. <a
name="citation69g"></a><a href="#footnote69g"
class="citation">[69g]</a>&nbsp; The way that he took, led him
directly into this condition; for who can expect other things of
one that follows such courses?&nbsp; Besides, when he was in his
Shop, he could not abide to be doing; He was naturally given to
Idleness: He loved to live high, but his hands refused to labour;
and what else can the end of such an one be, but that which the
wise man saith?&nbsp; The Drunkard and the Glutton shall come to
poverty, and drowsiness shall cloath a man with rags. <a
name="citation70a"></a><a href="#footnote70a"
class="citation">[70a]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But now, methinks, when he was brought thus low,
he should have considered the hand of God that was gone out
against him, and should have smote upon the breast, and have
returned.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Consideration, good consideration was far from
him, he was as stout and proud now, as ever in all his life, and
was as high too in the pursuit of his sin, as when he was in the
midst of his fulness; only he went now <a
name="citation70b"></a><a href="#footnote70b"
class="citation">[70b]</a> like a tyred Jade, the Devil had rid
him almost off of his leggs.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but what did he do when all was almost
gone?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Two things were now his play. <a
name="citation70c"></a><a href="#footnote70c"
class="citation">[70c]</a> 1.&nbsp; He bore all in hand by
Swearing, and Cracking and Lying, that he was as well to pass, as
he was the first day he set up for himself, yea that he had
rather got than lost; and he had at his beck some of his
Companions that would swear to confirm it as fast as he.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This was double wickedness, &rsquo;twas a sin to
say it, and another to swear it.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true, but what evil is that that he
will not doe, that is left of God, as I believe Mr. Badman
was?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; And what was the other thing?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why, that which I hinted before, he was for
looking out for a rich Wife: <a name="citation70d"></a><a
href="#footnote70d" class="citation">[70d]</a> and now I am come
to some more of his invented, devised, designed, and abominable
Roguery, such that will yet declare him to be a most desperate
sinner.</p>
<p>The thing was this: A Wife he wanted, or rather Money; for as
for a woman, he could have Whores enow at his whistle.&nbsp; But,
as I said, he wanted Money, and that must be got by a Wife, or no
way; nor could he so easily get a Wife neither, except he became
an Artist at the way of dissembling; nor would dissembling do
among that people that could dissemble as well as he.&nbsp; But
there dwelt a Maid not far from him, that was both godly, <a
name="citation70e"></a><a href="#footnote70e"
class="citation">[70e]</a> and one that had a good Portion, but
how to get her, there lay all the craft. <a
name="citation71a"></a><a href="#footnote71a"
class="citation">[71a]</a>&nbsp; Well, he calls a Council of some
of his most trusty and cunning Companions, <a
name="citation71b"></a><a href="#footnote71b"
class="citation">[71b]</a> and breaks his mind to them; to wit,
that he had a mind to marry: and he also told them to whom; But,
said he, how shall I accomplish my end, she is Religious, and I
am not?&nbsp; Then one of them made reply, saying, Since she is
Religious, you must pretend to be so likewise, and that for some
time before you go to her: Mark therefore whither she goes daily
to hear, and do you go thither also; but there you must be sure
to behave your self soberly, and make as if you liked the Word
wonderful well; stand also where she may see you, and when you
come home, be sure that you walk the street very soberly, and go
within sight of her: This done for a while, then go to her, and
first talk of how sorry you are for your sins, and shew great
love to the Religion that she is of; still speaking well of her
Preachers and of her godly acquaintance, bewailing your hard hap,
that it was not your lot to be acquainted with her and her
fellow-Professors sooner; and this is the way to get her.&nbsp;
Also you must write down Sermons, talk of Scriptures, and protest
that you came a wooing to her, only because she is Godly, and
because you should count it your greatest happiness if you might
but have such an one: As for her Money, slight it, it will be
never the further off, that&rsquo;s the way to come soonest at
it, for she will be jealous at first that you come for her Money;
you know what she has, but make not a word about it.&nbsp; Do
this, and you shall see if you do not intangle the Lass.</p>
<p>Thus was the snare laid for this poor honest Maid, and she was
quickly catched in his pit.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Why, did he take this counsel?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Did he! yes, and after a while, went as boldly to
her, <a name="citation71c"></a><a href="#footnote71c"
class="citation">[71c]</a> and that under a Vizzard of Religion,
as if he had been for Honesty and Godliness, one of the most
sincere and upright-hearted in England.&nbsp; He observed all his
points, and followed the advice of his Counsellers, and quickly
obtained her too; for natural parts he had, he was tall, and
fair, and had plain, but very good Cloaths on his back; and his
Religion was the more easily attained; for he had seen something
in the house of his Father, and first Master, and so could the
more readily put himself into the Form and Shew thereof.</p>
<p>So he appointed his day, and went to her, as that he might
easily do, for she had neither father nor mother to oppose.&nbsp;
Well, when he was come, and had given her a civil Complement, <a
name="citation72a"></a><a href="#footnote72a"
class="citation">[72a]</a> to let her understand why he was come,
then he began and told her, That he had found in his heart a
great deal of love to her Person; and that, of all the Damosels
in the world he had pitched upon her, if she thought fit, to make
her his beloved wife.&nbsp; The reasons, as he told her, why he
had pitched upon her were, her Religious and personal
Excellencies; and therefore intreated her to take his condition
into her tender and loving consideration.&nbsp; As for the world,
quoth he, I have a very good trade, and can maintain my self and
Family well, while my wife sits still on her seat; I have got
thus, and thus much already, and feel money come in every day,
but that is not the thing that I aim at, &rsquo;tis an honest and
godly Wife.&nbsp; Then he would present her with a good Book or
two, pretending how much good he had got by them himself.&nbsp;
He would also be often speaking well of godly Ministers,
especially of those that he perceived she liked, and loved
most.&nbsp; Besides, he would be often telling of her, what a
godly Father he had, and what a new man he was also become
himself; and thus did this treacherous Dealer, deal with this
honest and good Girl, to her great grief and sorrow, as afterward
you shall hear.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But had the maid no friend to looke after
her?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Her Father and Mother were dead, and that he knew
well enough, and so she was the more easily overcome by his
naughty lying tongue.&nbsp; But if she had never so many friends,
she might have been beguiled by him.&nbsp; It is too much the
custom of young people now, to think themselves wise enough to
make their own Choyce, and that they need not ask counsel of
those that are older and also wiser then they: <a
name="citation72b"></a><a href="#footnote72b"
class="citation">[72b]</a> but this is a great fault in them, and
many of them have paid dear for it.&nbsp; Well, to be short, in
little time Mr. Badman obtains his desire, <a
name="citation73a"></a><a href="#footnote73a"
class="citation">[73a]</a> gets this honest Girl and her money,
is married to her, brings her home, makes a Feast, entertains her
royally, but her Portion must pay for all.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This was wonderfull deceitfull doings, a man
shall seldom hear of the like.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; By this his doing, he shewed how little he feared
God, <a name="citation73b"></a><a href="#footnote73b"
class="citation">[73b]</a> and what little dread he had of his
Judgments.&nbsp; For all this carriage, and all these words were
by him premeditated evil, he knew he lyed, he knew he dissembled;
yea, he knew that he made use of the name of God, of Religion,
good Men, and good Books, but as a stalking-Horse, thereby the
better to catch his game.&nbsp; In all this his glorious pretense
of Religion, he was but a glorious painted Hypocrite, and
hypocrisie is the highest sin that a poor carnal wretch can
attain unto; it is also a sin that most dareth God, and that also
bringeth the greater damnation.&nbsp; Now was he a whited Wall,
now was he a painted Sepulchre; <a name="citation73c"></a><a
href="#footnote73c" class="citation">[73c]</a> now was he a grave
that appeared not; for this poor honest, godly Damosel, little
thought that both her peace, and comfort, and estate, and
liberty, and person, and all, were going to her burial, <a
name="citation73d"></a><a href="#footnote73d"
class="citation">[73d]</a> when she was going to be married to
Mr. Badman; And yet so it was, she enjoyed her self but little
afterwards; she was as if she was dead and buried, to what she
enjoyed before.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Certainly some wonderfull Judgment of God must
attend and overtake such wicked men as these.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You may be sure that they shall have Judgment to
the full, for all these things, when the day of Judgment is
come.&nbsp; But as for Judgment upon them in this life, it doth
not alwayes come, no not upon those that are worthy
thereof.&nbsp; They that tempt God are delivered, and they that
work wickedness are set up: <a name="citation73e"></a><a
href="#footnote73e" class="citation">[73e]</a>&nbsp; But they are
reserved to the day of wrath, and then for their wickedness, God
will repay them to their faces. <a name="citation73f"></a><a
href="#footnote73f" class="citation">[73f]</a>&nbsp; The wicked
is reserved to the day of destruction, they shall be brought
forth to the day of wrath; who shall declare his way to his face?
and who shall repay him what he hath done? yet shall he be
brought to the grave, and remain in the tomb. <a
name="citation73g"></a><a href="#footnote73g"
class="citation">[73g]</a>&nbsp; That is, ordinarily they escape
God&rsquo;s hand in this life, save only a few Examples are made,
that others may be cautioned, and take warning thereby: But at
the day of Judgment they must be rebuked for their evil with the
lashes of devouring fire.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Can you give me no examples of Gods wrath upon
men that have acted this tragical wicked deed Mr. Badman.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes; <a name="citation74a"></a><a
href="#footnote74a" class="citation">[74a]</a> Hamor and Shechem,
and all the men of their City, for attempting to make God and
Religion the stalking-Horse to get Jacobs daughters to wife, were
together slain with the edge of the sword.&nbsp; A Judgment of
God upon them, no doubt, for their dissembling in that
matter.&nbsp; All manner of lying and dissembling is dreadfull,
but to make God and Religion a Disguise, therewith to blind thy
Dissimulation from others eyes, is highly provoking to the Divine
Majesty.</p>

</a>I knew one that dwelt not far off from our Town, that got him
a wife as Mr. Badman got his; but he did not enjoy her long: for
one night as he was riding home (from his companions, where he
had been at a neighbouring Town) his horse threw him to the
ground, where he was found dead at break of day; frightfully and
lamentably mangled with his fall, and besmeared with his own
blood.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but pray return again to Mr. Badman, how
did he carry it to his wife, after he was married to her?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Nay, let us take things along as we go.&nbsp; He
had not been married but a little while, but his Creditors came
upon him <a name="citation74c"></a><a href="#footnote74c"
class="citation">[74c]</a> for their money: He deferred them a
little while, but at last things were come to that point, that
pay he must, or must do worse; so he appointed them a time, and
they came for their money, and he payed them down with her money
before her eyes, for those goods that he had profusely spent
among his Whores long before, (besides the portion that his
Father gave him) to the value of two hundred pounds.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This beginning was bad; but what shall I say?
&rsquo;twas like Mr. Badman himself.&nbsp; Poor woman, this was
but a bad beginning for her, I fear it filled her with trouble
enough, as I think such a beginning would have done, one, perhaps
much stronger than she.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Trouble, ay, you may be sure of it, but now
&rsquo;twas too late to repent, <a name="citation75a"></a><a
href="#footnote75a" class="citation">[75a]</a> she should have
looked better to herself, when being wary would have done her
good; her harms may be an advantage to others, that will learn to
take heed thereby; but for her self, she must take what follows,
even such a life now as Mr. Badman her Husband will lead her, and
that will be bad enough.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This beginning was bad, and yet I fear it was but
the beginning of bad.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You may he sure, that it was but the beginning of
badness, for other evils came on apace; as for instance: it was
but a little while after he was married, <a
name="citation75b"></a><a href="#footnote75b"
class="citation">[75b]</a> but he hangs his Religion upon the
hedge, or rather dealt with it as men deal with their old
Cloaths, who cast them off, or leave them to others to wear, for
his part he would be Religious no longer.</p>
<p>Now therefore he had pulled off his Vizzard, and began to shew
himself in his old shape, a base, wicked, debauched fellow, (and
now the poor woman saw that she was betrayed indeed;) now also
his old Companions begin to flock about him, and to haunt his
house and Shop as formerly: And who with them but Mr. Badman? and
who with him again but they?</p>
<p>Now those good people that used to company with his Wife,
began to be ama[t]ed and discouraged; <a
name="citation75c"></a><a href="#footnote75c"
class="citation">[75c]</a> also he would frown and gloat upon
them, as it he abhorred the appearance of them: so that in little
time he drove all good company from her, and made her sit
solitary by herself.&nbsp; He also began now to go out a nights
to those Drabs <a name="citation75d"></a><a href="#footnote75d"
class="citation">[75d]</a> who were his Familiars before, with
whom he would stay somtimes till midnight, and sometimes till
almost morning, and then would come home as drunk as a Swine; and
this was the course of Mr. Badman.</p>
<p>Now, when he came home in this case, if his wife did but speak
a word to him, about where he had been, and why he had so abused
himself, though her words were spoken in never so much meekness
and love, then she was Whore, <a name="citation76a"></a><a
href="#footnote76a" class="citation">[76a]</a> and Bitch, and
Jade; and &rsquo;twas well if she miss&rsquo;d his fingers and
heels.&nbsp; Sometimes also he would bring his Puncks home to his
house, and wo be to his wife when they were gone, if she did not
entertain them with all varieties possible, and also carry it
lovingly to them.</p>
<p>Thus this good woman was made by Badman her Husband, to
possess nothing but disappointments as to all that he had
promised her, or that she hoped to have at his hands.</p>
<p>But that that added pressing weight to all her sorrow, was,
that, as he had cast away all Religion himself, so he attempted,
if possible, to make her do so too. <a name="citation76b"></a><a
href="#footnote76b" class="citation">[76b]</a>&nbsp; He would not
suffer her to go out to the Preaching of the Word of Christ, nor
to the rest of his Appointments, for the health and salvation of
her Soul: he would now taunt at, and reflectingly speak of her
Preachers; <a name="citation76c"></a><a href="#footnote76c"
class="citation">[76c]</a> and would receive, yea raise scandals
of them, to her very great grief and affliction.</p>
<p>Now she scarce durst go to an honest Neighbours house, or have
a good Book in her hand; specially when he had his companions in
his house, or had got a little drink in his head.&nbsp; He would
also, when he perceived that she was dejected, speak tauntingly,
<a name="citation76d"></a><a href="#footnote76d"
class="citation">[76d]</a> and mockingly to her in the presence
of his Companions, calling of her his Religious Wife, his demure
Dame, and the like; also he would make a sport of her among his
wanton ones abroad.</p>
<p>If she did ask him (as sometimes she would) to let her go out
to a Sermon, he would in a currish manner reply, Keep at home,
keep at home, and look to your business, we cannot live by
hearing of Sermons. <a name="citation76e"></a><a
href="#footnote76e" class="citation">[76e]</a>&nbsp; If she still
urged that he would let her goe, then he would say to her, Goe if
you dare.&nbsp; He would also charge her with giving of what he
had to her Ministers, when, vile wretch, he had spent it on his
vain Companions before.</p>
<p>This was the life that Mr. Badmans good wife lived, within few
months after he had married her.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This was a disappointment indeed.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; A disappointment indeed, as ever, I think, poor
woman had.&nbsp; One would think that the Knave might a little
let her have had her will, since it was nothing but to be honest,
and since she brought him so sweet, so lumping a Portion, for she
brought hundreds into his house: I say, one would think he should
have let her had her own will a little, since she desired it only
in the Service and Worship of God: but could she win him to grant
her that? no, not a bit if it would have saved her life.&nbsp;
True, sometimes she would steal out when he was from home, on a
Journey, or among his drunken companions, but with all privacy
imaginable; <a name="citation77a"></a><a href="#footnote77a"
class="citation">[77a]</a> and, poor woman, this advantage she
had, she carried it so to all her Neighbours, that, though many
of them were but carnal, yet they would not betray her, or tell
of her going out to the Word, if they saw it, but would rather
endeavour to hide it from Mr. Badman himself.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This carriage of his to her, was enough to break
her heart.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It was enough to do it indeed, yea it did
effectually do it.&nbsp; It killed her in time, yea it was all
the time a killing of her.&nbsp; She would often-times when she
sate by her self, thus mournfully bewail her condition: <a
name="citation77b"></a><a href="#footnote77b"
class="citation">[77b]</a> Wo is me that I sojourn in Meshech,
and that I dwell in the tents of Kedar; my soul hath long time
dwelt with him that hateth peace. <a name="citation77c"></a><a
href="#footnote77c" class="citation">[77c]</a>&nbsp; O what shall
be given unto thee, thou deceitful tongue? or what shall be done
unto thee, thou false tongue?&nbsp; I am a Woman grieved in
spirit, my Husband has bought me and sold me for his lusts:
&rsquo;Twas not me, but my Money that he wanted: O that he had
had it, so I had had my liberty!</p>
<p>This she said, not of contempt of his Person, but of his
Conditions, and because she saw that by his hypocritical tongue,
he had brought her not only almost to beggery, but robbed her of
the Word of God.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; It is a deadly thing, I see, to be unequally
yoaked with Unbelievers.&nbsp; If this woman had had a good
Husband, how happily might they have lived together!&nbsp; Such
an one would have prayed for her, taught her, and also would have
encourages her in the Faith, and ways of God: But now, poor
creature, instead of this, there is nothing but the quite
contrary.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It is a deadly thing indeed, and therefore, by the
Word of God his people are forbid to be joyned in marriage with
them. <a name="citation77d"></a><a href="#footnote77d"
class="citation">[77d]</a>&nbsp; Be not, saith it, unequally
yoaked together with unbelievers; for what fellowship hath
righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light
with darkness?&nbsp; And what Concord hath Christ with Belial? or
what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel?&nbsp; And what
agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? <a
name="citation78a"></a><a href="#footnote78a"
class="citation">[78a]</a>&nbsp; There can be no agreement where
such Matches are made, even God himself hath declared the
contrary, from the beginning of the world.&nbsp; I (says he) will
put enmity betwixt thee and the woman, betwixt thy seed and her
seed. <a name="citation78b"></a><a href="#footnote78b"
class="citation">[78b]</a>&nbsp; Therefore he saith in another
place, they can mix no better than Iron and Clay.&nbsp; I say,
they cannot agree, they cannot be one, and therefore they should
be aware at first, and not lightly receive such into their
affections.&nbsp; God has often made such Matches bitter,
especially to his own.&nbsp; Such matches are, as God said of
Elie&rsquo;s Sons that were spared, to consume the eyes, and to
grieve the heart.&nbsp; Oh the wailing, and lamentation that they
have made that have been thus yoaked, especially if they were
such as would be so yoaked, against their light, and good counsel
to the contrary.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Alas! he deluded her with his tongue, and feigned
reformation.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Well, well; she should have gone more warily to
work: <a name="citation78d"></a><a href="#footnote78d"
class="citation">[78d]</a> what if she had acquainted some of her
best, most knowing, and godly friends therewith? what if she had
engaged a Godly Minister or two to have talked with Mr.
Badman?&nbsp; Also, what if she had laid wait round about him, to
espie if he was not otherwise behind her back than he was before
her face?&nbsp; And besides, I verily think (since in the
multitude of Counsellors there is safety) that if she had
acquainted the Congregation with it, and desired them to spend
some time in prayer to God about it, and if she must have had
him, to have received him as to his godliness, upon the Judgment
of others, rather than her own, (she knowing them to be Godly and
Judicious, and unbiassed men) she had had more peace all her life
after; than to trust to her own poor, raw, womanish Judgment, as
she did.&nbsp; Love is blind, and will see nothing amiss, where
others may see an hundred faults.&nbsp; Therefore I say, she
should not have trusted to her own thoughts in the matter of his
Goodness.</p>
<p>As to his Person, there she was fittest to judge, because she
was to be the person pleased, but as to his Godliness, there the
Word was the fittest Judge, and they that could best understand
it, because God was therein to be pleased.&nbsp; I wish <a
name="citation79a"></a><a href="#footnote79a"
class="citation">[79a]</a> that all young Maidens will take heed
of being beguiled with flattering words, with feigning and lying
speeches, and take the best way to preserve themselves from being
bought and sold by wicked men, as she was; lest they repent with
her, when (as to this) repentance will do them no good, but for
their unadvisedness goe sorrowing to their graves.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, things are past with this poor woman, and
cannot be called back, let others <a name="citation79b"></a><a
href="#footnote79b" class="citation">[79b]</a> beware, by her
misfortunes, lest they also fall into her distress.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; That is the thing that I say, let them take heed,
lest for their unadvisedness the smart, as this poor woman has
done.&nbsp; And ah! methinks, that they that yet are single
persons, and that are tempted to marry to such as Mr. Badman;
would, to inform, and warn themselves in this matter, before they
intangle themselves, but goe to some that already are in the
snare, and ask them how it is with them, as to the suitable, or
unsuitableness of their marriage, and desire their advice.&nbsp;
Surely they would ring such a peal in their ears about the
unequality, unsuitableness, disadvantages, and disquietments, and
sins that attend such marriages, that would make them beware as
long as they live.&nbsp; But the bird in the air, knows not the
notes of the bird in the snare, untill she comes thither herself:
Besides, to make up such marriages, Satan, and carnal Reason, and
Lust, or at least Inconsiderateness, has the chiefest hand; and
where these things bear sway, designs, though never so
destructive, will goe headlong on: and therefore I fear, that but
little warning will be taken by young Girls, at Mr. Badmans wives
affliction.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But are there no disswasive arguments to lay
before such, to prevent their future misery.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes: There is the Law of God, that forbiddeth
marriage with unbelievers.&nbsp; These kind of marriages also are
condemned even by irrational creatures.&nbsp; 1. It is forbidden
by the Law of God both in the Old Testament and in the New.&nbsp;
1. In the Old.&nbsp; Thou shalt not make Marriages with them; Thy
daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt
thou take unto thy son, Deut. 7. 4, 5. <a
name="citation80a"></a><a href="#footnote80a"
class="citation">[80a]</a>&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; In the New Testament it
is forbidden.&nbsp; Be ye not unequally yoaked together with
unbelievers; Let them marry to whom they will, only in the Lord.
<a name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b"
class="citation">[80b]</a></p>
<p>Here now is a prohibition, <a name="citation80c"></a><a
href="#footnote80c" class="citation">[80c]</a> plainly forbidding
the Believer to marry with the Unbeliever, therefore they should
not do it.&nbsp; Again, these unwarrantable Marriages, are, as I
may so say, condemned by irrational creatures, who will not
couple but with their own sort: Will the Sheep couple with a Dog,
the Partridge with a Crow, or the Feasant with an Owl?&nbsp; No,
they will strictly tye up themselves to those of their own sort
only: Yea, it sets all the world a wondring, when they see or
hear the contrary.&nbsp; Man only is most subject to wink at, and
allow of these unlawful mixtures of men and women; Because man
only is a sinful Beast, a sinful Bird, therefore he, above all,
will take upon him by rebellious actions to answer, or rather to
oppose and violate the Law of his God and Creator; nor shall
these, or other Interogatories, [What fellowship? what concord?
what agreement? what communion can there be in such Marriages?]
be counted of weight, or thought worth the answering by him.</p>
<p>But further.&nbsp; The dangers <a name="citation80d"></a><a
href="#footnote80d" class="citation">[80d]</a> that such do
commonly run themselves into, should be to others a disswasive
argument to stop them from doing the like: for besides the
distresses of Mr. Badmans wife, many that have had very hopefull
beginnings for heaven, have by vertue of the mischiefs that have
attended these unlawfull marriages, miserably and fearfully
miscarried.&nbsp; Soon after such marriages, Conviction (the
first step toward heaven) hath ceased; Prayer (the next step
toward Heaven) hath ceased; Hungrings and thirstings after
salvation (another step towards the Kingdom of Heaven) have
ceased.&nbsp; In a word, such marriages have estranged them from
the Word, from their godly and faithful Friends, and have brought
them again into carnal company, among carnal Friends, and also
into carnal Delights, where, and with whom they have in
conclusion both sinfully abode, and miserably perished.</p>
<p>And this is one reason why God hath forbidden this kind of
unequal marriages.&nbsp; For they, saith he, meaning the ungodly,
will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve
other Gods, so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you,
and destroy you suddenly. <a name="citation81a"></a><a
href="#footnote81a" class="citation">[81a]</a>&nbsp; Now mark,
there were some in Israel, that would, notwithstanding this
prohibition, venture to marry to the Heathens and Unbelievers:
But what followed?&nbsp; They served their Idols, they sacrificed
their Sons and their Daughters unto Devils.&nbsp; Thus were they
defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own
Inventions.&nbsp; Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled
against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own
Inheritance. <a name="citation81b"></a><a href="#footnote81b"
class="citation">[81b]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But let&rsquo;s return again to Mr. Badman; had
he any Children by his wife?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes, seven.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I doubt they were but badly brought up.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; One of them loved its Mother dearly, and would
constantly harken to her voice.&nbsp; Now that Child <a
name="citation81c"></a><a href="#footnote81c"
class="citation">[81c]</a> she had the opportunity to instruct in
the Principles of Christian Religion, and it became a very
gracious child.&nbsp; But that child Mr. Badman could not abide,
he would seldom afford it a pleasant word, but would scowl and
frown upon it, speak churlishly and doggedly to it, and though as
to Nature it was the most feeble of the seven, yet it oftenest
felt the weight of its Fathers fingers.&nbsp; Three of his
Children did directly follow his steps, and began to be as vile
as (in his youth) he was himself.&nbsp; The other that remained
became a kind of mungrel Professors, not so bad as their Father,
nor so good as their Mother, but were betwixt them both.&nbsp;
They had their Mothers Notions, and their Fathers Actions, and
were much like those that you read of in the Book of Nehemiah;
These children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not
speak in the Jews Language, but according to the language of each
people. <a name="citation81d"></a><a href="#footnote81d"
class="citation">[81d]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; What you say in this matter, is observable, and
if I take not my mark amiss, it often happeneth after this manner
where such unlawful Marriages are contracted.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It sometimes doth so, and the reason, with respect
to their Parents, is this: Where the one of the Parents is godly,
and the other ungodly and vile, (though they can agree in
begetting of Children, yet) they strive for their Children when
they are born. <a name="citation82a"></a><a href="#footnote82a"
class="citation">[82a]</a>&nbsp; The godly Parent strives for the
child, and by Prayers, Counsel and good Examples, labours to make
it holy in body and soul, and so fit for the Kingdom of Heaven;
but the ungodly would have it like himself, wicked and base and
sinful; and so they both give instructions accordingly:
instructions did I say? yea, and Examples too, according to their
minds.&nbsp; Thus the godly, as Hannah, is presenting her Samuel
unto the Lord: but the ungodly, like them that went before them,
are for offering their Children to Moloch, to an Idol, to sin, to
the Devil, and to Hell.&nbsp; Thus one harkeneth to the Law of
their Mother, and is preserved from destruction, but as for the
other, as their Fathers did, so do they.&nbsp; Thus did Mr.
Badman and his wife part some of their Children betwixt them; but
as for the other three that were as &rsquo;twere Mungrels,
betwixt both, they were like unto those that you read of in
Kings, They feared the Lord, but served their own Idols. <a
name="citation82b"></a><a href="#footnote82b"
class="citation">[82b]</a>&nbsp; They had, as I sail, their
Mothers Notions, and I will adde, Profession too, but their
Fathers Lusts, and something of his Life.&nbsp; Now their Father
did not like them, because they had their Mothers tongue; and the
Mother did not like them because they had still their Fathers
heart and life; nor were they indeed fit company for good or
bad.&nbsp; The Good would not trust them because they were bad,
the Bad would not trust them because they were good, viz.&nbsp;
The good would not trust them because they were bad in their
Lives, and the bad would not trust them because they were good in
their Words: So they were forced with Esau to joyn in affinity
with Ishmael; to wit, to look out a people that were Hypocrites
like themselves, and with them they matcht, and lived and
died.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Poor woman, she could not but have much
perplexity.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yea, and poor Children, that ever they were sent
into the world as the fruit of the loyns, and under the
government of such a father as Mr. Badman.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; You say right, for such children, lye, almost
under all manner of disadvantages: but we must say nothing,
because this also is the sovereign Will of God.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; We may not by any means object against God: yet we
may talk of the advantages, and disadvantages that Children have
by having for their Parents such as are either Godly, or the
contrary.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; You say right, we may so, and pray now, since we
are about it, speak something in brief unto it, that is, unto
this; What advantage those Children have above others, that have
for their Parents such as indeed are Godly.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; So I will, only I must first premise these two or
three things. <a name="citation83a"></a><a href="#footnote83a"
class="citation">[83a]</a></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; They have not the advantage of Election for their
fathers sakes.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; They are born, as others, the children of wrath,
though they come of Godly Parents.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Grace comes not unto them as an Inheritance, because
they have Godly Parents.&nbsp; These things premised I shall now
proceed.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The children of Godly Parents are the children of
many Prayers: they are prayed for before, and Prayed for after
they are born, and the Prayer of a godly Father and godly Mother
doth much.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; They have the advantage of what restraint is
possible, from what evils their Parents see them inclinable to,
and that is a second mercy.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; They have the advantage of Godly instruction, and of
being told which be, and which be not the right ways of the
Lord.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; They have also those ways commended unto them, and
spoken well of in their hearing, that are good.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Such are also, what may be, kept out of evil company,
from evil Books, and from being taught the way of Swearing,
Lying, and the like, as Sabbath-breaking, and mocking at good
men, and good things, and this is a very great mercy.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; They have also the benefit of a godly life set before
them doctrinally by their Parents, and that doctrine backt with a
godly and holy example: and all these are very great
advantages.</p>
<p>Now all these advantages, the children of ungodly Parents
want; <a name="citation84a"></a><a href="#footnote84a"
class="citation">[84a]</a> and so are more in danger of being
carried away with the error of the wicked.&nbsp; For ungodly
Parents neither Pray for their Children, nor do, nor can they
heartily instruct them; they do not after a godly manner restrain
them from evil, nor do they keep them from evil company.&nbsp;
They are not grieved at, nor yet do they forewarn their children
to beware of such evil actions that are abomination to God, and
to all good men.&nbsp; They let their children break the Sabbath,
swear, lye, be wicked and vain.&nbsp; They commend not to their
children an holy life, nor set a good example before their
eyes.&nbsp; No, they do in all things contrary: Estranging of
their children what they can, from the love of God and all good
men, so soon as they are born.&nbsp; Therefore it is a very great
Judgment of God upon children to be the Offspring of base and
ungodly men. <a name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b"
class="citation">[84b]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but before we leave Mr. Badmans wife and
children, I have a mind, if you please, to enquire a little more
after one thing, the which I am sure you can satisfie me in.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; What is that?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; You said a while ago, that this Mr. Badman would
not suffer his wife to go out to hear such godly Ministers as she
liked, but said if she did, she had as good never come home any
more.&nbsp; Did he often carry it thus to her?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; He did say so, he did often say so.&nbsp; This I
told you then, and had also then told you more, but that other
things put me out.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well said, pray therefore now go on.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; So I will.&nbsp; Upon a time, she was on a Lords
day for going to hear a Sermon, and Mr. Badman was unwilling <a
name="citation84c"></a><a href="#footnote84c"
class="citation">[84c]</a> she should: but she at that time, as
it seems, did put on more courage than she was wont; and
therefore, after she had spent upon him, a great many fair words
and entreaties, if perhaps she might have prevailed by them, but
all to no purpose at all: At last she said she would go, and
rendred this reason for it; I have an Husband, but also a God; my
God has commanded me, and that upon pain of damnation, to be a
continual Worshipper of him, and that in the way of his own
Appointments: I have an Husband, but also a Soul, and my Soul
ought to be more unto me, than all the world besides.&nbsp; This
soul of mine I will look after, care for, and (if I can) provide
it an Heaven for its habitation.&nbsp; You are commanded to love
me, as you love your own body, and so do I love you; <a
name="citation85a"></a><a href="#footnote85a"
class="citation">[85a]</a> but I tell you true, I preferr my Soul
before all the world, and its Salvation I will seek.</p>
<p>At this, first, <a name="citation85b"></a><a
href="#footnote85b" class="citation">[85b]</a> he gave her an
ugly wish, and then fell into a fearfull rage, and sware moreover
that if she did go, he would make both her, and all her damnable
Brotherhood (for so he was pleased to call them) to repent their
coming thither.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But what should he mean by that?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You may easily guess what he meant: he meant, he
would turn Informer, and so either weary out those that she
loved, from meeting together to Worship God; or make them pay
dearly for their so doing; the which if he did, he knew it would
vex every vein of her tender heart.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But do you think Mr. Badman would have been so
base?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Truly he had malice, and enmity enough in his
heart to do it, onely he was a Tradesman; also he knew that he
must live by his neighbours, and so he had that little wit in his
anger, that he refrained himself, and did it not.&nbsp; But, as I
said, he had malice and envy enough in his heart <a
name="citation85c"></a><a href="#footnote85c"
class="citation">[85c]</a> to have made him to do it, only he
thought it would worst him in his trade: yet these three things
he would be doing.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; He would be putting of others on to molest and abuse
her friends.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; He would be glad when he heard that any mischief
befell them.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; And would laugh at her, when he saw her troubled for
them.&nbsp; And now I have told you Mr. Badmans way as to
this.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But was he not afraid of the Judgments of God,
that did fly about at that time?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; He regarded not the Judgment nor Mercy of God, for
had he at all done that, he could not have done as he did.&nbsp;
But what Judgments do you mean?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Such Judgments, that if Mr Badman himself had
taken but sober notice of, they might have made him a hung down
his ears.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why, have you heard of any such persons that the
Judgments of God have overtaken.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Yes, and so, I believe, have you too, though you
make so strange about it.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I have so indeed, to my astonishment and
wonder.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray, therefore, if you please, tell me what it
is, as to this, that you know; and then, perhaps, I may also say
something to you of the same.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp;

</a>In <a name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86"
class="citation">[86]</a> our Town there was one W. S. a man of a
very wicked life; and he, when there seemed to be countenance
given to it, would needs turn Informer.&nbsp; Well, so he did,
and was as diligent in his business as most of them could be; he
would watch a nights, climb Trees, and range the Woods a days, if
possible, to find out the Meeters, for then they were forced to
meet in the Fields: yea, he would curse them bitterly, and swear
most fearfully what he would do to them when he found them.&nbsp;
Well, after he had gone on like a Bedlam in his course a while,
and had done some mischiefs to the people, he was stricken by the
hand of God, and that in this manner.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Although he had his tongue naturally at will, now he
was taken with a faultering in his speech, and could not for
weeks together speak otherwise, than just like a man that was
drunk.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Then he was taken with a drauling, or slabbering at
his mouth, which slabber sometimes would hang at his mouth well
nigh half way down to the ground.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Then he had such a weakness in the back sinews of his
Neck, that oft times he could not look up before him, unless he
clapped his hand hard upon his forehead, and held up his head
that way, by strength of hand.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; After this his speech went quite away, and he could
speak no more than a Swine or a Bear.&nbsp; Therefore, like one
of them, he would gruntle and make an ugly noyse, according as he
was offended, or pleased, or would have any thing done,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>In this posture he continued for the space of half a year, or
thereabouts, all the while otherwise well, and could go about his
business, save once that he had a fall from the Bell as it hangs
in our Steeple, which &rsquo;twas a wonder it did not kill him:
But after that he also walked about, till God had made him a
sufficient spectacle of his Judgment for his sin, and then on a
sudden he was stricken and dyed miserably: and so there was an
end of him and his doings.</p>
<p>I will tell you of another.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>About four miles from St. Neots, there was a Gentleman had a
man, and he would needs be an Informer, and a lusty young man he
was.&nbsp; Well, an Informer he was, and did much distress some
people, and had perfected his Informations so effectually against
some, that there was nothing further to do, but for the
Constables to make distress on the people, that he might have the
Money or Goods; and as I heard, he hastened them much to do
it.&nbsp; Now while he was in the heat of his work, as he stood
one day by the Fire-side, he had (it should seem) a mind to a Sop
in the Pan, (for the Spit was then at the fire,) so he went to
make him one; but behold, a Dog (so say his own Dog) took
distaste at something, and bit his Master by the Leg; the which
bite, notwithstanding all the means that was used to cure him,
turned (as was said) to a Gangrene; however, that wound was his
death, and that a dreadful one too: for my Relator said, that he
lay in such a condition by this bite, (as the beginning) till his
flesh rotted from off him before he went out of the world.&nbsp;
But what need I instance in particular persons, when the
Judgement of God against this kind of people was made manifest, I
think I may say, if not in all, yet in most of the Counties in
England where such poor Creatures were.&nbsp; But I would, if it
had been the will of God, that neither I nor any body else, could
tell you more of these Stories: True stories, that are neither
Lye, nor Romance.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, I also heard of both these my self, and of
more too, as remarkable in their kind as these, if I had any list
to tell them: but let us leave those that are behind to others,
or to the coming of Christ, who then will justifie or condemn
them as the merit of their work shall require; or if they
repented, and found mercy, I shall be glad when I know it, for I
wish not a curse to the Soul of mine Enemy.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; There can be no pleasure in the telling of such
stories, though to hear of them may do us a pleasure: They may
put us in mind that there is a God that judgeth in the earth, and
that doth not alwayes forget nor deferre to hear the Crye of the
destitute; They also carry along with them both Caution and
Counsel to those that are the survivors of such.&nbsp; Let us
tremble at the Judgements of God, and be afraid of sinning
against him, and it shall be our protection.&nbsp; It shall go
well with them that fear God, that fear before him.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well Sir, as you have intimated, so I think we
have in this place spoken enough about these kind of men; if you
please, let us return again to Mr. Badman himself, if you have
any more to say of him.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; More! we have yet scarce throughly begun with Any
thing that we have said.&nbsp; All the particulars are in
themselves so full of badness, that we have rather only looked in
them, than indeed said any thing to them: but we will pass them,
and proceed.&nbsp; You have heard of the sins of his Youth, of
his Apprentiship, and how he set up, and married, and what a life
he hath led his wife; and now I will tell you some more <a
name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a"
class="citation">[88a]</a> of his pranks.&nbsp; He had the very
knack of Knavery; had he, as I said before, been bound to serve
an Apprentiship to all these things, he could not have been more
cunning, he could not have been more artificial at it.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Nor perhaps so artificially neither.&nbsp; For as
none can teach Goodness like to God himself, so concerning Sin
and Knavery, none can teach a man it like the Devil, to whom, as
I perceive, Mr. Badman went to School from his Childhood to the
end of his life.&nbsp; But pray Sir, make a beginning.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Well so I will.&nbsp; You may remember that I told
you what a condition he was in for Money before he did marry, and
how he got a rich Wife, with whose Money he paid his debts: Now
when he had paid his debts, he having some Moneys left, he sets
up again <a name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b"
class="citation">[88b]</a> as briskly as ever, keeps a great
Shop, drives a great Trade, and runs again a great way into debt;
but now not into the debt of one or two, but into the debt of
many, so that at last he came to owe some thousands; and thus he
went on a good while.&nbsp; And to pursue his ends the better, he
began now to study to please all men, and to suit himself to any
company; he could now be as they, say as they, that is, if he
listed; and then he would list, when he perceived that by so
doing, he might either make them his Customers or Creditors for
his Commodities.&nbsp; If he dealt with honest men, (as with some
honest men he did) then he would be as they; talk as they, seem
to be sober as they, talk of Justice and Religion as they, and
against Debauchery as they; yea, and would too seem to shew a
dislike of them that said, did, or were otherwise than
honest.</p>
<p>Again, when he did light among those that were bad, then he
would be as they, but yet more close and cautiously, except he
were sure of his company: Then he would carry it openly, be as
they; say, Damn&rsquo;em and Sink&rsquo;em, as they.&nbsp; If
they railed on Good men, so could he; <a name="citation89"></a><a
href="#footnote89" class="citation">[89]</a> if they railed on
Religion, so could he: if they talked beastly, vainly, idlely, so
would he; if they were for drinking, swearing, whoring, or any
the like Villanies, so was he.&nbsp; This was now the path he
trod in, and could do all artificially, as any man alive.&nbsp;
And now he thought himself a perfect man, he thought he was
always a Boy till now.&nbsp; What think you now of Mr.
Badman?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Think! why, I think he was an Atheist: For no man
but an Atheist can do this.&nbsp; I say, it cannot be, but that
the man that is such as this Mr. Badman, must be a rank and
stinking Atheist; for he that believes that there is either God
or Devil, Heaven or Hell, or Death, and Judgment after, cannot
doe as Mr. Badman did; I mean, if he could do these things
without reluctancy and check of Conscience; yea, if he had not
sorrow and remorse for such abominable sins as these.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Nay, he was so far off from reluctancies and
remorse of Conscience for these things, that he counted them the
excellency of his Attainments, the quintessence of his Wit, his
rare and singular vertues, such as but few besides himself could
be the Masters of.&nbsp; Therefore, as for those that made boggle
and stop at things, and that could not in Conscience, and for
fear of Death and Judgement, do such things as he; he would call
them Fools and Noddies, and charge them for being frighted with
the talk of unseen Bugbears; and would encourage them, if they
would be men indeed, to labour after the attainment of this his
excellent art.&nbsp; He would often-times please himself <a
name="citation90a"></a><a href="#footnote90a"
class="citation">[90a]</a> with the thoughts of what he could do
in this matter, saying within himself; I can be religious, and
irreligious, I can be any thing, or nothing; I can swear, and
speak against swearing; I can lye, and speak against lying; I can
drink, wench, be unclean, and defraud, and not be troubled for
it: Now I enjoy my self, and am Master of mine own wayes, and not
they of me.&nbsp; This I have attained with much study, great
care, and more pains.&nbsp; But this his talk should be only with
himself, to his wife, who he knew durst not divulge it; or among
his Intimates, to whom he knew he might say any thing.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Did I call him before an Atheist?&nbsp; I may
call him now a Devil, or a man possessed with one, if not with
many.&nbsp; I think that there cannot be found in every corner
such an one as this.&nbsp; True, it is said of King Ahaz, that be
sinned more and more; and of Ahab, that he sold himself to work
wickedness; and of the men of Sodom, that they were sinners
exceedingly before the Lord. <a name="citation90b"></a><a
href="#footnote90b" class="citation">[90b]</a></p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; An Atheist he was no doubt, if there be such a
thing as an Atheist in the world, but for all his brags of
perfection and security in his wickedness, I believe that at
times God did let down fire from Heaven into his
Conscience.&nbsp; True, I believe he would quickly put it out
again, and grow more desperate and wicked afterward, but this
also turned to his destruction, as afterward you may hear. <a
name="citation90c"></a><a href="#footnote90c"
class="citation">[90c]</a></p>
<p>But I am not of your mind, to think that there are but few
such in the world; except you mean as to the Degree of wickedness
unto which he had attained.&nbsp; For otherwise, no doubt, <a
name="citation90d"></a><a href="#footnote90d"
class="citation">[90d]</a> there is abundance of such as he: men
of the same mind, of the same principles, and of the same
conscience too, to put them into practice.&nbsp; Yea, I believe
that there are many that are endeavouring to attain to the same
pitch of wickedness; and all them are such as he, in the Judgment
of the Law; nor will their want of hellish wit to attain thereto,
excuse them at the day of Judgment.&nbsp; You know that in all
Science, some are more arch than some; and so it is in the art,
as well as in the practice of wickedness: some are two-fold, and
some seven-fold more the children of Hell than others, (and yet
all the children of Hell,) else they would all be Masters, and
none scholars in the school of wickedness.&nbsp; But there must
be Masters, and there must be Learners; Mr. Badman was a master
in this art, and therefore it follows that he must be an arch and
chief one in that mystery.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; You are in the right, for I perceive that some
men, though they desire it, cannot be so arch in the practice
thereof as others, but are (as I suppose they call them) fools
and dunces to the rest, their heads and capacities will not serve
them to act and do so wickedly.&nbsp; But Mr. Badman wanted not a
wicked head to contrive, as well as a wicked heart to do his
wickedness.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; True, but yet I say, such men shall at the day of
Judgment, be judged, not only for what they are, but also for
what they would be.&nbsp; For if the thought of foolishness is
sin, <a name="citation91a"></a><a href="#footnote91a"
class="citation">[91a]</a> doubtless the desire of foolishness is
more sin: and if the desire be more, the endeavour after it must
needs be more and more. <a name="citation91b"></a><a
href="#footnote91b" class="citation">[91b]</a>&nbsp; He then that
is not an artificial Atheist and Transgressor, yet if he desires
to be so, if he endeavoureth to be so, he shall be Judged and
condemned to Hell for such an one.&nbsp; For the Law Judgeth men,
as I said, according to what they would be.&nbsp; He that looketh
upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her
already in his heart. <a name="citation91c"></a><a
href="#footnote91c" class="citation">[91c]</a>&nbsp; By the same
rule, he that would steal, doth steal; he that would cheat, doth
cheat; he that would swear, doth swear; and he that would commit
adultery, doth do so.&nbsp; For God Judgeth men according to the
working of their minds, and saith; As he thinketh, so is
he.&nbsp; That is, so is he in his heart, in his intentions, in
his desires, in his endeavours; and Gods Law, I say, lays hold of
the desires, intentions and endeavours, even as it lays hold of
the act of wickedness it self. <a name="citation91d"></a><a
href="#footnote91d" class="citation">[91d]</a>&nbsp; A man then
that desires to be as bad as Mr. Badman, (and desires to be so
wicked have many in their hearts) though he never attains to that
proficiency in wickedness as he, shall yet be Judged for as bad a
man as he, because &rsquo;twas in his desires to be such a wicked
one.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But this height of wickedness in Mr. Badman, will
not yet out of my mind.&nbsp; This hard, desperate, or what shall
I call it, diabolicall frame of heart, was in him a foundation, a
ground-work, to all acts and deeds that were evil.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; The heart, and the desperate wickedness of it, is
the foundation and groundwork of all.&nbsp; Atheism, professed
and practicall, spring both out of the heart, yea and all manner
of evils besides. <a name="citation92a"></a><a
href="#footnote92a" class="citation">[92a]</a>&nbsp; For they be
not bad deeds that make a bad man, but he is already a bad man
that doth bad deeds.&nbsp; A man must be wicked before he can do
wickedness. <a name="citation92b"></a><a href="#footnote92b"
class="citation">[92b]</a>&nbsp; Wickedness proceedeth from the
wicked.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an evil tree that bears evil fruit, men
gather no grapes of thorns; the heart therefore must be evil,
before the man can do evil, and good before the man doth
good.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Now I see the reason why Mr. Badman was so base,
as to get a Wife by dissimulation, and to abuse her so like a
Villain when he had got her, it was because he was before by a
wicked heart prepared to act wickedness.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You may be sure of it; for from within, out of the
heart of man proccedeth evil thoughts, Adulteries, Fornications,
Murders, Thefts, Coveteousness, Wickedness, Deceit,
Lasciviousness, an evil Eye, Blasphemy, Pride, Foolishness.&nbsp;
All these things come from within, and defile a man. <a
name="citation92c"></a><a href="#footnote92c"
class="citation">[92c]</a>&nbsp; And a man, as his naughty mind
inclines him, makes use of these, or any of these, to gratifie
his lust, to promote his designs, to revenge his malice, to
enrich, or to wallow himself in the foolish pleasures and
pastimes of this life: And all these did Mr. Badman do, even to
the utmost, if either opportunity, or purse, or perfidiousness,
would help him to the obtaining of his purpose.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Purse!&nbsp; Why he could not but have Purse to
do almost what he would, having married a wife with so much
money.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Hold you there; some of Mr. Badmans sins were
costly, as his drinking, and whoring, and keeping other bad
company; though he was a man that had ways too many to get money,
as well as ways too many to spend it.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Had he then such a good Trade, for all he was
such a bad man? or was his Calling so gainfull to him, as alwayes
to keep his Purses belly full, though he was himself a great
spender?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; No: It was not his Trade that did it, though he
had a pretty trade too.&nbsp; He had another way to get Money,
and that by hatfulls and pocketfulls at a time.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Why I trow he was no Highway man, was he?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I will be sparing in my speech as to that, though
some have muttered as if he could ride out now and then, about no
body but himself knew what, over night, and come home all dirty
and weary next morning.&nbsp; But that is not the thing I aim
at.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray let me know it, if you think it convenient
that I should.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I will tell you: It was this, he had an art to
Break, <a name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a"
class="citation">[93a]</a> and get hatfulls of money by
breaking.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But what do you mean by Mr. Badmans Breaking? you
speak mystically, do you not?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; No, no, I speak plainly.&nbsp; Or, if you will
have it in plainer language, &rsquo;tis this: When Mr. Badman had
swaggered and whored away most of his wifes portion, he began to
feel that he could not much longer stand upon his legs in this
course of life, and keep up his Trade and Repute (such as he had)
in the world; but by the new Engine of Breaking.&nbsp; Wherefore,
upon a time, he gives a great, and sudden <a
name="citation93b"></a><a href="#footnote93b"
class="citation">[93b]</a> rush into several mens debts, to the
value of about four or five thousand pound, driving at the same
time a very great trade, by selling many things for less than
they cost him, to get him custom, therewith to blind his
Creditors eyes.&nbsp; His Creditors therefore feeling that he had
a great employ, and dreaming that it must needs at length turn to
a very good account to them, trusted him freely without mistrust,
and so did others too, to the value of what was mentioned
before.&nbsp; Well, when Mr. Badman had well feathered his Nest
with other mens goods and money, after a little time <a
name="citation93c"></a><a href="#footnote93c"
class="citation">[93c]</a> he breaks.&nbsp; And by and by it is
noysed abroad that Mr. Badman had shut up Shop, was gone, and
could trade no longer.&nbsp; Now, by that time his breaking was
come to his Creditors ears, he had by Craft and Knavery made so
sure of what he had, that his Creditors could not touch a
penny.&nbsp; Well, when he had done, he sends his mournfull
sugered letters to his Creditors, to let them understand what had
happened unto him, and desired them not to be severe with him; <a
name="citation94a"></a><a href="#footnote94a"
class="citation">[94a]</a> for he bore towards all men an honest
mind, and would pay so far as he was able.&nbsp; Now he sends his
letters by a man <a name="citation94b"></a><a href="#footnote94b"
class="citation">[94b]</a> confederate with him, who could make
both the worst, and best of Mr. Badmans case: The best for Mr.
Badman, and the worst for his Creditors.&nbsp; So when he comes
to them, he both bemoans them, and condoles Mr. Badmans
condition: Telling of them, that without a speedy bringing of
things to a conclusion, Mr. Badman would be able to make them no
satisfaction, but at present he both could, and would, and that
to the utmost of his power: and to that end, he desired that they
would come over to him.&nbsp; Well, his Creditors appoint him a
time, and come over; and he, mean while, authorizes another to
treat with them, but will not be seen himself, unless it was on a
Sunday, lest they should snap him with a Writ.&nbsp; So his
deputed friend treats with them about their concern with Mr.
Badman, first telling them of the great care that Mr. Badman took
to satisfie them and all men for whatsoever he ought, as far as
in him lay, and, how little he thought a while since to be in
this low condition.&nbsp; He pleaded also the greatness of his
Charge, the greatness of Taxes, the Badness of the times, and the
great Losses that he had by many of his customers, some of which
died in his debt, others were run away, and for many that were
alive, he never expected a farthi[n]g from them.&nbsp; Yet
nevertheless he would shew himself an honest man, and would pay
as far as he was able; and if they were willing to come to terms,
he would make a composition with them, (for he was not able to
pay them all.)&nbsp; The Creditors asked what he would give? <a
name="citation94c"></a><a href="#footnote94c"
class="citation">[94c]</a>&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas replyed, Half a
crown in the pound.&nbsp; At this they began to huff, and he to
renew his complaint and entreaty; but the Creditors would not
hear, and so for that time their meeting without success broke
up.&nbsp; But after his Creditors were in cool blood, and
admitting of second thoughts, and fearing lest delays should make
them lose all, they admit of a second debate, come together
again, and by many words, and great ado, they obtained five
shillings i&rsquo;th&rsquo; pound. <a name="citation94d"></a><a
href="#footnote94d" class="citation">[94d]</a>&nbsp; So the money
was produced, Releases and Discharges drawn, signed, and sealed,
Books crossed, and all things confirmed; and then Mr. Badman can
put his head out of dores again, and be a better man than when he
shut up Shop, by several thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; And did he do thus indeed?</p>
<p>Wise, Yes, once, and again.&nbsp; I think he brake twice or
thrice.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; And did he do it before he had need to do it?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Need!&nbsp; What do you mean by need? there is no
need at any time for a man to play the knave. <a
name="citation95"></a><a href="#footnote95"
class="citation">[95]</a>&nbsp; He did it of a wicked mind, to
defraud and beguile his Creditors: he had wherewithall of his
Father, and also by his Wife, to have lived upon, with lawfull
labour, like an honest man.&nbsp; He had also when he made this
wicked Break (though he had been a profuse and prodigal spender)
to have paid his creditors their own to a farthing.&nbsp; But had
he done so, he had not done like himself, like Mr. Badman; had
he, I say, dealt like an honest man, he had then gone out of Mr.
Badmans road.&nbsp; He did it therefore of a dishonest mind, and
to a wicked end; to wit, that he might have wherewithall,
howsoever unlawfully gotten, to follow his Cups and Queans, and
to live in the full swinge of his lusts, even as he did
before.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Why this was a meer Cheat.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It was a cheat indeed.&nbsp; This way of breaking,
it is else but a more neat way of Thieving, of picking of
pockets, of breaking open of shops, and of taking from men what
one has nothing to do with.&nbsp; But though it seem easie, it is
hard to learn, no man that has conscience to God or man, can ever
be his Crafts Master in this Hellish art.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Oh! Sirs! what a wicked man was this?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; A wicked man indeed.&nbsp; By this art he could
tell how to make men send their goods to his shop, and then be
glad to take a penny for that for which he had promised before it
came thither, to give them a Groat: I say, he could make them
glad to take a Crown for a pounds worth, and a thousand for that
for which he had promised before to give them four thousand
pounds.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This argueth that Mr. Badman had but little
conscience.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; This argued that Mr. Badman had No Conscience at
all; for Conscience, the least spark of a good Conscience cannot
endure this.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Before we go any further in Mr. Badmans matters,
let me desire you, if you please, to give me an answer to these
two questions. <a name="citation96a"></a><a href="#footnote96a"
class="citation">[96a]</a></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; What do you find in the Word of God against such a
practice, as this of Mr. Badmans is? <a name="citation96b"></a><a
href="#footnote96b" class="citation">[96b]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; What would you have a man do that is in his Creditors
debt, and can neither pay him what be owes him, nor go on in a
trade any longer?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I will answer you as well as I can.&nbsp; And
first to the first of your questions.&nbsp; To wit, What I find
in the Word of God against such a practice, as this of Mr.
Badmans is.</p>
<p>Answ.&nbsp; The Word of God doth forbid this wickedness; and
to make it the more odious in our eyes, it joyns it with Theft
and Robbery: Thou shalt not, says God, defraud thy neighbour, nor
rob him. <a name="citation96c"></a><a href="#footnote96c"
class="citation">[96c]</a>&nbsp; Thou shalt not defraud, that is,
deceive or beguile.&nbsp; Now thus to break, is to defraud,
deceive and beguile; which is, as you see, forbidden by the God
of Heaven: Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, nor rob
him.&nbsp; It is a kind of theft and robbery, thus to defraud,
and beguile. <a name="citation96d"></a><a href="#footnote96d"
class="citation">[96d]</a>&nbsp; It is a wilely robbing of his
shop, and picking of his pocket: a thing odious to Reason and
Conscience, and contrary to the Law of nature.&nbsp; It is a
designed piece of wickedness, and therefore a double sin.&nbsp; A
man cannot do this great wickedness on a sudden, and through a
violent assault of Satan.&nbsp; He that will commit this sin,
must have time to deliberate, that by invention, he may make it
formidable, and that with lies and high dissimulations.&nbsp; He
that commits this wickedness, must first hatch it upon his bed,
beat his head about it, and lay his plot strong: So that to the
completing of such a wickedness, there must be adjoyned many
sins, and they too, must go hand in hand untill it be
compleated.&nbsp; But what saith the Scripture? <a
name="citation96e"></a><a href="#footnote96e"
class="citation">[96e]</a><a name="citation96f"></a><a
href="#footnote96f" class="citation">[96f]</a>&nbsp; Let no man
go beyond, and defraud his Brother in any matter, because the
Lord is the avenger of all such.&nbsp; But this kind of Breaking
is a going beyond my Brother; This is a compassing of him about
that I may catch him in my net; and as I said, an art to rob my
Brother, and to pick his pocket, and that with his consent.&nbsp;
Which doth not therefore mitigate, but so much the more greaten
and make odious the offence.&nbsp; For men that are thus wilily
abused cannot help themselves, they are taken in a deceitfull
net.&nbsp; But God will here concern himself, he will be the
avenger, he will be the avenger of all such either here or in
another world.</p>
<p>And this, the Apostle testifies again, where he saith; <a
name="citation97a"></a><a href="#footnote97a"
class="citation">[97a]</a> But he that doth wrong, shall receive
for the wrong that he hath done, and there is no respect of
persons. <a name="citation97b"></a><a href="#footnote97b"
class="citation">[97b]</a>&nbsp; That is, there is no man, be he
what he will, if he will be guilty of this sin, of going beyond,
of beguiling of, and doing wrong to his Brother, but God will
call him to an account for it, and will pay him with vengeance
for it too; for there is no respect of persons.</p>
<p>I might add, that this sin of wronging, of going beyond, and
defrauding of my Neighbour, it is like that first prank that the
Devil plaid with our first Parents, <a name="citation97c"></a><a
href="#footnote97c" class="citation">[97c]</a> (as the Altar that
Uriah built for Ahaz, was taken from the fashion of that that
stood at Damascus, to be the very pattern of it.)&nbsp; The
Serpent beguiled me, says Eve; Mr. Badman beguiles his
Creditors.&nbsp; The Serpent beguiled Eve with lying promises of
gain; and so did Mr. Badman beguile his Creditors.&nbsp; The
Serpent said one thing and meant another, when he beguiled Eve;
and so did Mr. Badman when he beguiled his Creditors.</p>
<p>That man therefore that doth thus deceive and beguile his
neighbour, imitateth the Devil; he taketh his examples from him,
and not from God, the Word, or good men: and this did Mr.
Badman.</p>
<p>And now to your second question: To wit, What I would have a
man do, that is in his Creditors debt, and that can neither pay
him, nor go on in a trade any longer? <a
name="citation97d"></a><a href="#footnote97d"
class="citation">[97d]</a></p>
<p>Answ.&nbsp; First of all.&nbsp; If this be his case, and he
knows it, let him not run one penny further in his Creditors
debt.&nbsp; For that cannot be done with good conscience.&nbsp;
He that knowes he cannot pay, and yet will run into debt; does
knowingly wrong and defraud his neighbour, and falls under that
sentence of the Word of God, The wicked borroweth and payeth not
again.&nbsp; Yea worse, he borrows though at the very same time
he knows that he cannot pay again.&nbsp; He doth also craftily
take away what is his Neighbours.&nbsp; That is therefore the
first thing that I would propound to such: Let him not run any
further into his Creditors debt. <a name="citation98a"></a><a
href="#footnote98a" class="citation">[98a]</a></p>
<p>Secondly, After this, let him consider, <a
name="citation98b"></a><a href="#footnote98b"
class="citation">[98b]</a> how, and by what means he was brought
into such a condition, that he could not pay his just
debts.&nbsp; To wit, whether it was by his own remisness in his
Calling, by living too high in Dyet or Apparel, by lending too
ravishingly that which was none of his own, to his loss; or
whether by the immediate hand and Judgment of God.</p>
<p>If by searching, he findes, that this is come upon him through
remisness in his Calling, Extravagancies in his Family, or the
like; let him labour for a sence of his sin and wickedness, <a
name="citation98c"></a><a href="#footnote98c"
class="citation">[98c]</a> for he has sinned against the Lord:
First, in his being slothfull in business, and in not providing,
to wit, of is own, by the sweat of his brows, or other honest
ways, for those of his own house. <a name="citation98d"></a><a
href="#footnote98d" class="citation">[98d]</a>&nbsp; And secondly
in being lavishing in Dyet and Apparel in the Family, or in
lending to others that which was none of his own.&nbsp; This
cannot be done with good conscience: it is both against reason
and nature, and therefore must be a sin against God.&nbsp; I say
therefore, if thus this debtor hath done, if ever he would live
quietly in conscience, and comfortably in his condition for the
future, let him humble himself before God, and repent of this his
wickedness.&nbsp; For he that is slothfull in his work, is
brother to him that is a great waster. <a
name="citation98e"></a><a href="#footnote98e"
class="citation">[98e]</a>&nbsp; To be slothfull and a waster
too, is to be as it were a double sinner.</p>
<p>But again, as this man should enquire into these things, so he
should also into this.&nbsp; How came I into this way of dealing
in which I have now miscarried? is it a way that my Parents
brought me up in, put me Apprentice to, or that by providence I
was first thrust into? or is it a way into which I have twisted
my self, as not being contented with my first lot, that by God
and my Parents I was cast into?&nbsp; This ought duly to be
considered. <a name="citation98f"></a><a href="#footnote98f"
class="citation">[98f]</a>&nbsp; And if upon search, a man shall
find that he is out of the place and Calling into which he was
put by his Parents, or the Providence of God, and has miscarried
in a new way, that through pride and dislike of his first state
he as chose rather to embrace; his miscarriage is his sin, the
fruit of his Pride, and a token of the Judgment of God upon him
for his leaving of his first state.&nbsp; And for this he ought,
as for the former, to be humble and penitent before the Lord.</p>
<p>But if by search, <a name="citation99a"></a><a
href="#footnote99a" class="citation">[99a]</a> he finds, that his
poverty came by none of these; if by honest search, he finds it
so, and can say with good conscience, I went not out of my place
and state in which God by his providence had put me; but have
abode with God in the calling wherein I was called, and have
wrought hard, and fared meanly, been civilly apparelled, and have
not directly, nor indirectly made away with my Creditors goods:
Then has his fall come upon him by the immediate hand of God,
whether by visible or invisible wayes.&nbsp; For sometimes it
comes by visible wayes, to wit, by Fire, by Thieves, by loss of
Cattel, or the wickedness of sinful dealers, &amp;c.&nbsp; And
sometimes by means invisible, and then no man knows how; we only
see things are going, but cannot see by what way they go.&nbsp;
Well, Now suppose that a man, by an immediate hand of God is
brought to a morsel of Bread, what must he do now? <a
name="citation99b"></a><a href="#footnote99b"
class="citation">[99b]</a></p>
<p>I answer: His surest way is still to think, that this is the
fruit of some sin, though possibly not sin in the management of
his calling, yet of some other sin.&nbsp; God casteth away the
substance of the wicked.&nbsp; Therefore let him still humble
himself before his God, because his hand is upon him, and say,
What sin is this, for which this hand of God is upon me? and let
him be diligent to find it out, for some sin is the cause of this
Judgment; for God doth not willingly afflict nor grieve the
children of men.&nbsp; Either the heart is too much set upon the
world, or Religion is too much neglected in thy Family, or some
thing.&nbsp; There is a Snake in the grass, a Worm in the gourd;
some sin in thy bosom, for the sake of which God doth thus deal
with thee.</p>
<p>Thirdly, This thus done, let that man again consider thus with
himself: Perhaps God is now changing of my Condition and state in
the world; he has let me live in fashion, in fulness, and
abundance of worldly glory, and I did not to his glory improve,
as I should, that his good dispensation to me. <a
name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a"
class="citation">[100a]</a>&nbsp; But when I lived in full and
fat pasture, I did there lift up the heel: Therefore he will now
turn me into hard Commons, that with leanness, and hunger, and
meanness, and want, I may spend the rest of my days.&nbsp; But
let him do this without murmering, and repining; let him do it in
a godly manner, submitting himself to the Judgment of God.&nbsp;
Let the rich rejoyce in that he is made low. <a
name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b"
class="citation">[100b]</a></p>
<p>This is duty, and it may be priviledg to those that are under
this hand of God.&nbsp; And for thy encouragement to this hard
work, (for this is a hard work) consider of these four things. <a
name="citation100c"></a><a href="#footnote100c"
class="citation">[100c]</a></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; This is right lying down under Gods hand, and the way
to be exalted in Gods time: when God would have Job embrace the
Dunghill, he embraces it, and says, The Lord giveth, and the Lord
hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord. <a
name="citation100d"></a><a href="#footnote100d"
class="citation">[100d]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Consider, That there are blessings also that attend a
low condition, more than all the world are aware of.&nbsp; A poor
condition has preventing mercy attending of it.&nbsp; The poor,
because they are poor, are not capable of sinning against God as
the rich man does.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Poor can more clearly see himself preserved by
the providence of God than the rich, for he trusteth in the
abundance of his riches. <a name="citation100e"></a><a
href="#footnote100e" class="citation">[100e]</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; It may be God has made thee poor, because he would
make thee rich.&nbsp; Hearken my beloved brethren, hath not God
chosen the poor of this world, rich in Faith, and heirs of a
Kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him? <a
name="citation100f"></a><a href="#footnote100f"
class="citation">[100f]</a></p>
<p>I am perswaded, if men upon whom this hand of God is, would
thus quietly lye down, and humble themselves under it, they would
find more peace, yea, more blessing of God attending them in it,
than the most of men are aware of.&nbsp; But this is an hard
Chapter, and therefore I do not expect that many should either
read it with pleasure, or desire to take my counsel.</p>
<p>Having thus spoken to the Broken man, with reference to his
own self; I will now speak to him as he stands related to his
Creditors.</p>
<p>In the next place therefore, let him fall upon the most <a
name="citation101a"></a><a href="#footnote101a"
class="citation">[101a]</a> honest way of dealing with his
Creditors, and that I think must be this.</p>
<p>First, Let him timely make them acquainted with his condition,
and also do to them these three things.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Let him heartily, and unfeignedly ask them
forgiveness for the wrong that he has done them.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Let him proffer them all, and the whole all that ever
he has in the world; let him hide nothing, let him strip himself
to his raiment for them; let him not keep a Ring, a Spoon, or any
thing from them.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; If none of these two will satisfie them, let him
proffer them his Body, to be at their dispose, to wit, either to
abide imprisonment their pleasure, or to be at their service,
till by labour and travel he hath made them such amends as they
in reason think fit, (only reserving something for the succour of
his poor and distressed Family out of his labour, which in
Reason, and Conscience, and Nature, he is bound also to take care
of:)&nbsp; Thus shall he make them what amends he is able, for
the Wrong that he hath done them in wasting and spending of their
Estates.</p>
<p>By thus doing, he submits himself to Gods rod, commits himself
to the dispose of his Providence; yea, by thus doing, he casteth
the lot of his present and future condition into the lap of his
Creditors, and leaves the whole dispose thereof to the Lord, <a
name="citation101b"></a><a href="#footnote101b"
class="citation">[101b]</a> even as he shall order and incline
their hearts to do with him.&nbsp; And let that be either to
forgive him; or to take that which he hath for satisfaction; or
to lay his body under affliction, this way or that, according to
Law; can he, I say, thus leave the whole dispose to God, let the
issue be what it will, that man shall have peace in his mind
afterward.&nbsp; And the comforts of that state, (which will be
comforts that attend Equity, Justice, and Duty,) will be more
unto him, because more according to Godliness, than can be the
comforts that are the fruits of Injustice, Fraudulency, and
Deceit.&nbsp; Besides, this is the way to engage God to favour
him by the sentence of his Creditors; (for He can entreat them to
use him kindly,) and he will do it when his ways are pleasing in
his sight: When a mans ways please the Lord, his enemies shall be
at peace with him; <a name="citation102a"></a><a
href="#footnote102a" class="citation">[102a]</a> And surely, for
a man to seek to make restitution for wrongs done, to the utmost
of his power, by what he is, has, and enjoys in this world, is
the best way, in that capacity, and with reference to that thing,
that a man can at this time be found active in.</p>
<p>But he that doth otherwise, abides in his sin, refuses to be
disposed of by the Providence of God, chuseth an high Estate,
though not attained in Gods way; when Gods Will is, that he
should descend into a low one: yea, he desperately saith in his
heart and actions, I will be mine own chooser, and that in mine
own way, whatever happens or follows thereupon.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; You have said well, in my mind.&nbsp; But suppose
now, that Mr. Badman was here, could he not object as to what you
have said, saying, Go and teach your Brethren, that are
Professors, this lesson, for they, as I am, are guilty of
Breaking; yea I am apt to think, of that which you call my
Knavish way of breaking; to wit, of breaking before they have
need to break.&nbsp; But if not so, yet they are guilty of
neglect in their Calling, <a name="citation102b"></a><a
href="#footnote102b" class="citation">[102b]</a> of living
higher, both in Fare and Apparrel, than their Trade or Income
will maintain.&nbsp; Besides, that they do break, all the world
very well knowes, and that they have the art to plead for a
composition, is very well known to men; and that it is usual with
them, to hide their Linnen, their Plate, their Jewels, and
(&rsquo;tis to be thought, sometimes Money and Goods besides,) is
as common as four eggs a penny.&nbsp; And thus they beguile men,
debauch their consciences, sin against their Profession, and
make, &rsquo;tis to be feared, their lusts in all this, and the
fulfilling of them, their end.&nbsp; I say, if Mr. Badman was
here to object thus unto you, what would be your reply?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Why I would say, I hope no Good man,
no man of good conscience, no man that either feareth God,
regardeth the credit of Religion, the peace of Gods people, or
the salvation of his own soul, will do thus.</p>
<p>Professors, such perhaps there may be, and who, upon earth can
help it?&nbsp; Jades there be of all colours. <a
name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a>&nbsp; If men will profess, and make
their profession a stalking-Horse to beguile their neighbours of
their estates, as Mr. Badman himself did, when he beguiled her
that now is with sorrow his wife, who can help it?&nbsp; The
Churches of old were pestered with such, and therefore no marvel
if these perilous difficult times be so.&nbsp; But mark how the
Apostle words it: Nay do wrong and defraud, and that your
Brethren: Know you not, that the unrighteous shall not inherit
the Kingdom of God?&nbsp; Be not deceived, neither Fornicator,
nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor abusers of
themselves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor
Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, shall inherit the
Kingdom of God. <a name="citation103b"></a><a
href="#footnote103b" class="citation">[103b]</a></p>
<p>None of these shall be saved in this state, nor shall
profession deliver them from the censure of the Godly, when they
shall be manifest such to be.&nbsp; But their profession we
cannot help: How can we help it, if men should ascribe to
themselves the title of Holy ones, Godly ones, Zealous ones,
Self-denying ones, or any other such glorious title? and while
they thus call themselves, they should be the veryest Rogues for
all evil, sin, and villany imaginable, who could help it?&nbsp;
True, they are a scandal to Religion, a grief to the honest
hearted, an offence to the world, and a stumbling stone to the
weak, and these offences have come, do come, and will come, do
what all the world can; but wo be to them through whom they come;
<a name="citation103c"></a><a href="#footnote103c"
class="citation">[103c]</a> let such professors therefore
disowned by all true Christians, and let them be reckoned among
those base men of the world which by such actions they most
resemble: They are Mr. Badmans Kindred.</p>
<p>For <a name="citation103d"></a><a href="#footnote103d"
class="citation">[103d]</a> they are a shame to Religion, I say
these slithy, rob-Shop, pick-pocket men, they are a shame to
Religion, and religious men should be ashamed of them.&nbsp; God
puts such an one among the Fools of the world, therefore let not
Christians put them among those that are wise for heaven.&nbsp;
As the Partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not, so he
that getteth riches and not by right, shall leave them in the
midst of his dayes, and at his end shall be a fool. <a
name="citation103e"></a><a href="#footnote103e"
class="citation">[103e]</a>&nbsp; And the man under consideration
is one of these, and therefore must look to fall by this
Judgment.</p>
<p>A professor! and practice such villianies as these! such an
one is not worthy to bear that name any longer.&nbsp; We may say
to such as the Prophet spake to their like, to wit, to the
rebellious that were in the house of Israel.&nbsp; Goe ye, serve
every man his Idols:&mdash;If ye will not hearken to the Law and
Testament of God, to lead your lives thereafter: but pollute Gods
holy name no more with your Gifts, and with your Idols. <a
name="citation104a"></a><a href="#footnote104a"
class="citation">[104a]</a></p>
<p>Goe professors, Goe; leave off profession, unless you will
lead your lives according to your profession.&nbsp; Better never
profess, than to make profession a stalking-horse to sin, Deceit,
to the Devil, and Hell.</p>
<p>The ground and rules of Religion allow not any such thing:
Receive us, says the Apostle, we have wronged no man, we have
corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man. <a
name="citation104b"></a><a href="#footnote104b"
class="citation">[104b]</a>&nbsp; Intimating, that those that are
guilty of wronging, corrupting or defrauding of any, should not
be admitted to the fellowship of Saints, no nor into the common
catalogue of Brethren with them.</p>
<p>Nor can men with all their Rhetorick, and Eloquent speaking
prove themselves fit for the Kingdom of Heaven, or men of good
conscience on earth. <a name="citation104c"></a><a
href="#footnote104c" class="citation">[104c]</a>&nbsp; O that
godly plea of Samuel: Behold here I am, says he, witness against
me, before the Lord, and before his Anointed, whose Oxe have I
taken, or whose Ass have I taken, or whom have I defrauded, whom
have I oppressed, <a name="citation104d"></a><a
href="#footnote104d" class="citation">[104d]</a> &amp;c?&nbsp;
This was to do like a man of good conscience indeed.&nbsp; And in
this his Appeal, he was so justified in the consciencies of the
whole Congregation, that they could not but with one voice, as
with one mouth, break out joyntly and say, Thou hast not
defrauded us, nor oppressed us. <a name="citation104e"></a><a
href="#footnote104e" class="citation">[104e]</a></p>
<p>A Professor, and defraud, away with him! a Professor should
not owe any man any thing, but love.&nbsp; A professor should
provide things, not of other mens, but of his own, of his own
honest getting, and that not onely in the sight of God, but of
all men; that he may adorn the Doctrine if God our Saviour in all
things.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But <a name="citation105a"></a><a
href="#footnote105a" class="citation">[105a]</a> suppose God
should blow upon a Professor in his Estate, and Calling, and he
should be run out before he is aware, must he be accounted to be
like Mr. Badman, and lie under the same reproach as he?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; No: <a name="citation105b"></a><a
href="#footnote105b" class="citation">[105b]</a> If he hath
dutifully done what he could to avoid it.&nbsp; It is possible
for a Ship to sink at sea, notwithstanding the most faithfull
endeavour of the most skilful Pilot under Heaven.&nbsp; And thus,
as I suppose, it was with the Prophet that left his wife in debt
to the hazarding the slavery of her children by the Creditors. <a
name="citation105c"></a><a href="#footnote105c"
class="citation">[105c]</a>&nbsp; He was no profuse man, nor one
that was given to defraud, for the Text says he feared God; yet,
as I said, he was run out more than she could pay.</p>
<p>If God would blow upon a man, who can help it? and he will do
so sometimes, <a name="citation105d"></a><a href="#footnote105d"
class="citation">[105d]</a> because he will change dispensations
with men, and because he will trye their Graces. <a
name="citation105e"></a><a href="#footnote105e"
class="citation">[105e]</a>&nbsp; Yea, also because he will
overthrow the wicked with his Judgments; and all these things are
seen in Job.&nbsp; But then the consideration of this, should bid
men have a care that they be honest, lest this comes upon them
for their sin: It should also bid them beware of launching
further into the world, than in an honest way by ordinary means
they can Godlily make their retreat; for the further in, the
greater fall.&nbsp; It should also teach them, to begg of God his
blessing upon their endeavours, their honest and lawfull
endeavours.&nbsp; And it should put them upon a diligent looking
to their steps, that if in their going they should hear the Ice
crack, they may timely goe back again.</p>
<p>These things considered, and duely put in practice, if God
will blow upon a man, then let him be content, and with Job
embrace the dunghill; let him give unto all their dues, and not
fight against the Providence of God, (but humble himself rather
under his mighty hand,) which comes to strip him naked and bare:
for he that doth otherwise, fights against God; and declares that
he is a stranger to that of Paul; I know both how to be abased,
and I know how to abound; every where, in all things, I am
instructed both to be full, and to be hungry, both to abound, and
to suffer need. <a name="citation105f"></a><a
href="#footnote105f" class="citation">[105f]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But Mr. Badman would not, I believe, have put
this difference &rsquo;twixt things feigned, and those that fall
of necessity.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; If he will not, God will, Conscience will; and
that not thine own only, but the Consciences of all those that
have seen the way, and that have known the truth of the condition
of such an one.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well: Let us at this time leave this matter, and
return again to Mr. Badman.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; With all my heart will I proceed to give you a
relation of what is yet behind of his Life, in order to our
discourse of his Death.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But pray do it with as much brevity as you
can.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why? are you a weary of my relating of things?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But it pleases me to hear a great deal
in few words.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I profess not my self an artist that way, but yet
as briefly as I can, I will pass through what of his Life is
behind; and again I shall begin with his fraudulent dealing (as
before I have shewed with his Creditors, so now) with his
Customers, and those that he had otherwise to deal withall.</p>
<p>He dealt by deceitfull Weights and Measures. <a
name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a>&nbsp; He kept weights to buy by, and
weights to sell by; measures to buy by, and measures to sell by:
those he bought by were too big, those he sold by were too
little.</p>
<p>Besides, he could use a thing called slight of hand, if he had
to do with other mens weights and measures, and by that means
make them whether he did buy or sell, yea though his Customer or
Chapman looked on, turn to his own advantage.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had the art to misreckon men in their Accounts
whether by weight, or measure, or money, and would often do it to
his worldly advantage, and their loss: What say you to Mr. Badman
now?</p>
<p>And if a question was made of his faithfull dealing, he had
his servants ready, that to his purpose he had brought up, that
would avouch and swear to his Book, or word: this was Mr. Badmans
practice; What think you of Mr. Badman now?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Think!&nbsp; Why I can think no other but that he
was a man left to himself, a naughty man; for these, as his
other, were naughty things; if the tree, as indeed it may, ought
to be judged, what it is by its fruits; then Mr. Badman must
needs be a bad Tree.&nbsp; But pray, for my further satisfaction,
shew me now by the Word of God, evil of this his practice: and
first of his using false Weights and Measures.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; The evil of that! why the evil of that appears to
every eye: the Heathens, that live like Beasts and Bruits in many
things, do abominate and abhorr such wickedness as this.&nbsp;
Let a man but look upon these things as he goes by, and he shall
see enough in them from the light of nature to make him loath so
base a practice; although Mr. Badman loved it.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But shew me something out of the Word against it,
will you?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I will willingly do it.&nbsp; And first we will
look into the Old Testament: <a name="citation107a"></a><a
href="#footnote107a" class="citation">[107a]</a> You shall, saith
God there, do no unrighteousness in Judgment, in mete-yard, in
weights or in measures, a just Ballance, a just Weight, a just
Ephah, and a just Hin shall you have. <a
name="citation107b"></a><a href="#footnote107b"
class="citation">[107b]</a>&nbsp; This is the Law of God, and
that which all men according to the Law of the land ought to
obey.&nbsp; So again: Ye shall have just Ballances, and a just
Ephah, &amp;c. <a name="citation107c"></a><a href="#footnote107c"
class="citation">[107c]</a></p>
<p>Now having shewed you the Law, I will also shew you how God
takes swerving therefrom.&nbsp; A false Ballance is not good; a
false Ballance is an abomination to the Lord. <a
name="citation107d"></a><a href="#footnote107d"
class="citation">[107d]</a>&nbsp; Some have just Weights but
false Ballances, and by vertue of those false Ballances, by their
just Weights, they deceive the Countrey: <a
name="citation107e"></a><a href="#footnote107e"
class="citation">[107e]</a> Wherefore, God first of all commands
that the Ballance be made Just: A just Ballance shalt thou
have.&nbsp; Else they may be, yea are, decievers, notwithstanding
their just weights.</p>
<p>Now, having commanded that men have a just Ballance, and
testifying that a false one is an abomination to the Lord, he
proceedeth also unto weight and measure.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a
small; <a name="citation107f"></a><a href="#footnote107f"
class="citation">[107f]</a> that is one to buy by, and another to
sell by, as Mr. Badman had.&nbsp; Thou shalt not have in thy
house divers measures, a great and a small, (and these had Mr.
Badman also) but thou shalt have a perfect and a just weight; a
perfect and a just measure shalt thou have, that thy days may be
lengthened in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.&nbsp;
For all that do such things, (that is, that use false Weights and
Measures) and all that do unrighteously are abomination to the
Lord.&nbsp; See now both how plentiful, and how punctual the
Scripture is in this matter.&nbsp; But perhaps it may be
objected, that all this is old Law, and therefore hath nothing to
do with us under the New Testament.&nbsp; (Not that I think you,
neighbour, will object thus:) Well, to this foolish objection,
let us make an Answer.&nbsp; First, he that makes this objection,
if he doth it to overthrow the authority of those Texts, <a
name="citation108a"></a><a href="#footnote108a"
class="citation">[108a]</a> discovereth that himself is first
cousen to Mr. Badman: For a Just man is willing to speak
reverently of those commands.&nbsp; That man therefore hath, I
doubt, but little conscience, if any at all that is good, that
thus objecteth against the Text: but let us look into the New
Testament, and there we shall see how Christ confirmeth the same:
Where he commandeth that men make to others good measure,
including also that they make good weight; telling such that doe
thus, or those that do it not, that they may be encouraged to do
it; Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running
over, shall men give into your bosom; for with the same measure
that ye mete withall, it shall be measured to you again: <a
name="citation108b"></a><a href="#footnote108b"
class="citation">[108b]</a> To wit, both from God and man.&nbsp;
For as God will shew his indignation against the false man, by
taking away even that he hath, so he will deliver up the false
man to the Oppressor, and the Extortioner shall catch from him,
as well as he hath catched from his neighbour; therefore another
Scripture saith, When thou shalt cease to deal treacherously,
they shall deal treacherously with thee.&nbsp; That the New
Testament also, hath an inspection into mens Trading, yea even
with their weights and measures, is evident from these general
exhortations. <a name="citation108c"></a><a href="#footnote108c"
class="citation">[108c]</a>&nbsp; Defraud not; lye not one to
another; let no man goe beyond his brother in any matter, for God
is the avenger of all such: whatsoever you do, do it heartily, as
unto the Lord, doing all in his name, to his glory; and the
like.&nbsp; All these injunctions and commandments do respect our
life and conversation among men, with reference to our dealing,
trading, and so consequently they forbid false, deceitful, yea
all doings that are corrupt.</p>
<p>Having thus in a word or two shewed you, that these things are
bad; I will next, for the conviction of those that use them, shew
you, where God saith they are to be found. <a
name="citation109a"></a><a href="#footnote109a"
class="citation">[109a]</a></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; They are not to be found in the house of the good and
godly man, for he, as his God, abhorrs them; but they are to be
found in the house of evil doers, <a name="citation109b"></a><a
href="#footnote109b" class="citation">[109b]</a> such as Mr.
Badmans is.&nbsp; Are there, saith the Prophet, yet the treasures
of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure
that is abomination? <a name="citation109c"></a><a
href="#footnote109c" class="citation">[109c]</a>&nbsp; Are they
there yet, notwithstanding Gods forbidding, notwithstanding Gods
tokens of anger against those that do such things?&nbsp; O how
loth is a wicked man to let goe a sweet, a gainful sin, when he
hath hold of it!&nbsp; They hold fast deceit, they refuse to let
it goe.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; These deceitful Weights and Measures are not to be
found in the house of the Mercifull, but in the house of the
Cruel; in the house of them that love to oppress. <a
name="citation109d"></a><a href="#footnote109d"
class="citation">[109d]</a>&nbsp; The Ballances of deceit are in
his hand, he loveth to oppress. <a name="citation109e"></a><a
href="#footnote109e" class="citation">[109e]</a>&nbsp; He is
given to oppression and cruelty, therefore he useth such wicked
things in his calling.&nbsp; Yea he is a very cheat, and as was
hinted before, concerning Mr. Badmans breaking, so I say now,
concerning his using these deceitful weights and measures, it is
as bad, as base, as to take a purse, or pick a pocket; for it is
a plain robbery, it takes away from a man that which is his own,
even the price of his money.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The deceitful Weights and Measures are not to be
found in the house of such as relieve the belly, and that cover
the loyns of the poor, but of such as indeed would swallow them
up. <a name="citation109f"></a><a href="#footnote109f"
class="citation">[109f]</a>&nbsp; Hear ye this, ye that swallow
up the needy, and that make the poor of the land to fail, saying,
When will the new Moon be gone that we may sell corn, and the
Sabbath that we may set forth Wheat, making the Ephah small and
the Sheckle great, (making the Measure small, and the Price
great) and falsifying the Ballances by deceit, that ye may buy
the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shooes, and sell
the refuse of the Wheat.&nbsp; The Lord hath sworn by the
excellencie of Jacob, surely I will not forget any of their
works. <a name="citation109g"></a><a href="#footnote109g"
class="citation">[109g]</a>&nbsp; So detestable and vile a thing
is this in the sight of God.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; God abominates the thoughts of calling of those that
use false weights and measures, by any other term than, that they
be Impure ones <a name="citation110a"></a><a href="#footnote110a"
class="citation">[110a]</a> or the like: Shall I count them pure
(saith he) with the bag of deceitful weights? <a
name="citation110b"></a><a href="#footnote110b"
class="citation">[110b]</a> no by no means, they are impure ones,
their hands are defiled, deceitful gain is in their houses, they
have gotten what they have by coveting an evil Covetousness, and
therefore must and shall be counted among the impure, among the
wicked of the world.</p>
<p>Thus you see how full and plain the Word of God is, against
this sin, and them that use it.&nbsp; And therefore Mr. Badman,
for that he used by these things thus to rook and cheat his
neighbours, is rightly rejected from having his Name in, and
among the catalogue of the godly.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But I am perswaded, that the using of these
things, and the doing by them thus deceitfully, is not counted so
great an evil by some.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Whether it be counted an evil or a vertue, by men,
it mattereth not; you see by the Scriptures, the Judgment of God
upon it.&nbsp; It was not counted an evil by Mr. Badman, nor is
it by any that still are treading in his steps.&nbsp; But, I say,
&rsquo;tis no matter how men esteem of things, let us adhere to
the Judgment of God.&nbsp; And the rather, because when we our
selves have done weighing and measuring to others, then God will
weigh and measure both us and our actions.&nbsp; And when he doth
so, as he will do shortly, then wo be to him to whom, and of
whose actions it shall be thus said by him: Tekel, Thou art
weighed in the Ballances, and art found wanting. <a
name="citation110c"></a><a href="#footnote110c"
class="citation">[110c]</a>&nbsp; God will then recompense their
evil of deceiving upon their own head, when he shall shut them
out of his presence, favour, and kingdom, for ever and ever.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis a wonder, that since Mr. Badmans
common practice was to do thus, that some one or more did not
find him out, and blame him for this his wickedness.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; For the generality of people, he went away clever
with his Knavery.&nbsp; For what with his Ballance, his false
Ballance, and good weight, and what with his slight of hand to
boot, he beguiled, sometimes a little, and sometimes more, most
that he had to deal with: Besides, those that use this naughty
trade, are either such as blind men with a shew of Religion, or
by hectoring the buyer out by words.&nbsp; I must confess Mr.
Badman was not so arch at the first; <a
name="citation111a"></a><a href="#footnote111a"
class="citation">[111a]</a> that is, to do it by shew of
Religion; for now he began to grow threadbare, (though some of
his brethren are arch enough this way, yea and of his sisters
too, for I told you at first that there was a great many of them,
and of them good:) but for hectoring, for swearing, for lying, if
these things would make weight and measure, they should not be
wanting to Mr. Badmans Customers.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Then it seem he kept good Weights, and a bad
Ballance; well that was better than that both should be bad.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; There lay the depth of his
deceit: <a name="citation111b"></a><a href="#footnote111b"
class="citation">[111b]</a> For if any at any time found fault,
that he used them hardly, and that they wanted their weight of
things; he would reply: Why did you not see them weighed? will
you not believe your own eyes: If you question my weights, pray
carry them whether you will, I will maintain them to be good and
just.&nbsp; The same he would say of his scales.&nbsp; So he
blinded all, by his Ballance.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This is cunning indeed: but as you say, there
must be also something done or said, to blind therewith, and this
I perceive Mr. Badman had.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; He had many ways to blind, but he was
never clever at it, by making a shew of Religion, (though he
cheated his wife therewith:) for he was, especially by those that
dwelt near him, too well known to do that, though he would bungle
at it as well as he could.&nbsp; But there are some that are arch
villains this way; they shall to view live a whole life
Religiously, and yet shall be guilty of these most horrible sins:
And yet Religion in it self is never the worse, nor yet the true
professors of it.&nbsp; But as Luther says, In the name of God
begins all mischief.&nbsp; For Hypocrites have no other way to
bring their evils to maturity, but by using and mixing the Name
of God and Religion therewith. <a name="citation112b"></a><a
href="#footnote112b" class="citation">[112b]</a>&nbsp; Thus they
become whited Walls; <a name="citation112a"></a><a
href="#footnote112a" class="citation">[112a]</a> for by this
white, the white of Religion, the dirt of their actions is
hid.&nbsp; Thus also they become graves that appear not, and they
that goe over them, (that have to do with them) are not aware of
them, but suffer themselves to be deluded by them.&nbsp; Yea, if
there shall, as there will sometimes, rise a doubt in the heart
of the buyer about the weight and measure he should have, why, he
suffereth his very sences to be also deluded, by recalling of his
Chapmans Religion to mind, and thinks verily that not his good
chapman but himself is out; for he dreams not that his chapman
can deceive.&nbsp; But if the buyer shall find it out, and shall
make it apparent, that he is beguiled; then shall he be healed by
having amends made, and perhaps fault shall be laid upon
servants, &amp;c. and so Master Cheat shall stand for a right
honest man in the eye of his Customer, though the next time he
shall pick his pocket again.</p>
<p>Some <a name="citation112c"></a><a href="#footnote112c"
class="citation">[112c]</a> plead Custom for their Cheat, as if
that could acquit them before the Tribunal of God: And others
say, it came to them for so much, and therefore another must take
it for so much, though there is wanting both as to weight and
measure: but in all these things there are Juggles; or if not,
such must know, <a name="citation112d"></a><a
href="#footnote112d" class="citation">[112d]</a> That that which
is altogether just, they must doe.&nbsp; Suppose that I be
cheated my self with a brass half-Crown, must I therefore cheat
another therewith? if this be bad in the whole, it is also bad in
the parts.&nbsp; Therefore however thou are dealt withall in thy
buying, yet thou must deal justly in selling, or thou sinnest
against thy soul, and art become as Mr. Badman.&nbsp; And know,
that a pretence to custom is nothing worth.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not
custom, but good conscience that will help at Gods Tribunal.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But I am perswaded, that that which is gotten by
men this way, doth them but little good.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I am of your mind for that, but this is not
considered by those thus minded.&nbsp; For if they can get it,
though they get, as we say, the Devil and all, by their getting,
yet they are content, and count that their getting is much.</p>
<p>Little good!&nbsp; Why do you think they consider that?&nbsp;
No: no more than they consider what they shall doe in the
Judgment, at the day of God Almighty, for their wrong getting of
what they get, and that is just nothing at all. <a
name="citation113a"></a><a href="#footnote113a"
class="citation">[113a]</a></p>
<p>But to give you a more direct answer.&nbsp; This kind of
getting, is so far off from doing them little good, that it doth
them no good at all; because thereby they lose their own souls;
What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and
lose his own soul? <a name="citation113b"></a><a
href="#footnote113b" class="citation">[113b]</a>&nbsp; He loseth
then, he loseth greatly that getteth after this fashion.&nbsp;
This is the man that is penny-wise, and pound-foolish; this is he
that loseth his good Sheep for a halfpennyworth of tarr; that
loseth a soul for a little of the world.&nbsp; And then what doth
he get thereby, but loss and dammage? <a
name="citation113c"></a><a href="#footnote113c"
class="citation">[113c]</a>&nbsp; Thus he getteth, or rather
loseth about the world to come: But what doth he get in this
world, more than travel and sorrow vexation of spirit, and
disappointment?&nbsp; Men aim at blessedness in getting, I mean,
at temporal blessedness; but the man that thus getteth, shall not
have that.&nbsp; For though an Inheritance after this manner may
be hastily gotten at the beginning, yet the end thereof shall not
be blessed.&nbsp; They gather it indeed, and think to keep it
too, but what says Solomon?&nbsp; God casteth it away.&nbsp; The
Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish, but he
casteth away the substance of the wicked.</p>
<p>The time, as I said, that they do enjoy it, it shall doe them
no good at all; but long to be sure they must not have it.&nbsp;
For God will either take it away in their life time, or else in
the generation following, according to that of Job: He, the
wicked, may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the
innocent shall divide the silver. <a name="citation113d"></a><a
href="#footnote113d" class="citation">[113d]</a></p>
<p>Consider that also that is written in the Proverbs: A good man
leaveth an Inheritance to his childrens children, and the wealth
of the sinner is laid up for the just. <a
name="citation113e"></a><a href="#footnote113e"
class="citation">[113e]</a>&nbsp; What then doth he get thereby,
that getteth by dishonest means? why he getteth Sin and Wrath,
Hell and Damnation: and now tell me how much he doth get.</p>
<p>This, I say, is his getting; so that as David says, we may be
bold to say too: I beheld the wicked in great prosperity, and
presently I cursed his habitation: for it cannot prosper with
him.&nbsp; Fluster and huff, and make a doe for a while he may,
but God hath determined that both he and it shall melt like
grease, and any observing man may see it so.&nbsp; Behold, the
unrighteous man in a way of Injustice getteth much, and loadeth
himself with thick Clay, but anon it withereth, it decayeth, and
even he, or the Generation following decline, and return to
beggery.</p>
<p>And this Mr. Badman, notwithstanding his cunning and crafty
tricks to get money, did dye, no body can tell whether worth a
farthing or no.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; He had all the bad tricks, I think, that it was
possible for a man to have, to get money; one would think that he
should a been rich.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You reckon too fast, if you count these all his
bad tricks to get money: For he had more besides. <a
name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a"
class="citation">[114a]</a></p>
<p>If his customers were in his Books (as it should goe hard but
he would have them there; at least, if he thought he could make
any advantage of them,) then, then would he be sure to impose
upon them his worst, even very bad Comodity, yet set down for it
the price that the best was sold at: like those that sold the
Refuse Wheat, or the worst of the wheat; making the Sheckle
great, <a name="citation114b"></a><a href="#footnote114b"
class="citation">[114b]</a> yet hoisting up the price: This was
Mr. Badmans way.&nbsp; He <a name="citation114c"></a><a
href="#footnote114c" class="citation">[114c]</a> would sell goods
that cost him not the best price by far, for as much as he sold
the best of all for.&nbsp; He had also a trick to mingle his
comodity, that that which was bad might goe off with the less
mistrust.</p>
<p>Besides, if his customers at any time paid him money, let them
look to themselves, and to their Acquitances, for he would
usually attempt to call for that payment again, specially if he
thought that there was hopes of making a prize thereby, and then
to be sure if they could not produce good and sufficient ground
of the payment, a hundred to one but they payed it again.&nbsp;
Sometimes the honest Chapman would appeal to his servants for
proof of the payment of money, but they were trained up by him to
say after his mind, right or wrong: so that, relief that way, he
could get none.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; It is a bad, yea an abominable thing for a man to
have such servants.&nbsp; For by such means a poor customer may
be undone and not know how to help himself.&nbsp; Alas! if the
master be so unconscionable, as I perceive Mr. Badman was, to
call for his money twice, and if his servant will swear that it
is a due debt, where is any help for such a man? he must sink,
there is no remedy.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; This is very bad, but this has been a practice,
and that hundreds of years agoe.&nbsp; But what saith the Word of
God?&nbsp; I will punish all those that leap upon the threshold,
which fill their masters houses with violence and deceit. <a
name="citation115a"></a><a href="#footnote115a"
class="citation">[115a]</a> <a name="citation115b"></a><a
href="#footnote115b" class="citation">[115b]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Badman also had this art; could he get a man at advantage,
that is, if his chapman durst not go from him, or if the comodity
he wanted could not for the present be conveniently had
elsewhere; Then let him look to himself, he would surely make his
purse-strings crack; he would exact upon him without any pity or
conscience.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; That was Extortion, was it not?&nbsp; I pray let
me hear your Judgment of Extortion, what it is, and when
committed?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Extortion <a name="citation115c"></a><a
href="#footnote115c" class="citation">[115c]</a> is a screwing
from men more than by the Law of God or men is right; and it is
committed sometimes by them in Office, about Fees, Rewards, and
the like: but &rsquo;tis most commonly committed by men of Trade,
who without all conscience, when they have the advantage, will
make a prey of their neighbour.&nbsp; And thus was Mr. Badman an
Extortioner; for although he did not exact, and force away, as
Bailifs and Clarks have used to doe; yet he had his
opportunities, and such cruelty to make use of them, that he
would often, in his way, be Extorting, and forcing of money out
of his Neighbours pocket.&nbsp; For every man that makes a prey
of his advantage upon his neighbours necessities, to force from
him more than in reason and conscience, according to the present
prizes of things such comodity is worth; may very well be called
an Extortioner, and Judged for one that hath No inheritance in
the Kingdom of God. <a name="citation115d"></a><a
href="#footnote115d" class="citation">[115d]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, this Badman was a sad wretch.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Thus you have often said before.&nbsp; But now we
are in discourse of this, give me leave a little to goe on.&nbsp;
We have a great many people in the Countrey too that live all
their dayes in the practice, and so under the guilt of Extortion:
people, alas! that think scorn to be so accounted.</p>
<p>As for Example: <a name="citation116a"></a><a
href="#footnote116a" class="citation">[116a]</a> There is a poor
body that dwells, we will suppose, so many miles from the Market;
and this man wants a Bushel of Grist, a pound of Butter, or a
Cheese for himself, his wife and poor children: But dwelling so
far from the Market, if he goes thither, he shall lose his dayes
work, which will be eight pence or ten pence dammage to him, and
that is something to a poor man.&nbsp; So he goeth to one of his
Masters or Dames for what he wanteth, and asks them to help him
with such a thing: Yes, say they, you may have it; but withall
they will give him a gripe, perhaps make him pay as much (or
more) for it at home, as they can get when they have carryed it
five miles to a Market, yea and that too for the Refuse of their
Commodity.&nbsp; But in this the Women are especially faulty, in
the sale of their Butter and Cheese, &amp;c.&nbsp; Now this is a
kind of Extortion, it is a making a prey of the necessity of the
poor, it is a grinding of their faces, a buying and selling of
them.</p>
<p>But above all, your <a name="citation116b"></a><a
href="#footnote116b" class="citation">[116b]</a> Hucksters, that
buy up the poor mans Victuals by whole-sale, and sell it to him
again for unreasonable gains, by retale, and as we call it, by
piece meal; they are got into a way, after a stingeing rate, to
play their game upon such by Extortion: I mean such who buy up
Butter, Cheese, Eggs, Bacon, &amp;c. by whole sale, and sell it
again (as they call it) by penny worths, two penny worths, a half
penny worth, or the like, to the poor, all the week after the
market is past.</p>
<p>These, though I will not condemn them all, do, many of them,
bite and pinch the poor by this kind of evil dealing.&nbsp; These
destroy the poor because he is poor, and that is a grievous
sin.&nbsp; He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches,
and that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want. <a
name="citation116c"></a><a href="#footnote116c"
class="citation">[116c]</a>&nbsp; Therefore he saith again, Rob
not the poor because he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted in
the gate; for the Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul
of them that spoile them.</p>
<p>Oh that he that gripeth and grindeth the face of the poor,
would take notice of these two Scriptures!&nbsp; Here is
threatned the destruction of the Estate, yea and of the Soul too,
of them that oppress the poor.&nbsp; Their Soul we shall better
see where, and in what condition that is in, when the day of Doom
is come; but for the Estates of such, they usually quickly
moulter; and that sometimes all men, and sometimes no man knows
how.</p>
<p>Besides, these are Usurers, yea they take usury for victuals,
which thing the Lord has forbidden. <a name="citation117a"></a><a
href="#footnote117a" class="citation">[117a]</a>&nbsp; And
because they cannot so well do it on the Market-day, therefore
they do it, as I said, when the market is over; for then the poor
falls into their mouths, and are necessitated to have, as they
can, for their need, and they are resolved they shall pay soundly
for it.&nbsp; Perhaps some will find fault for my medling thus
with other folks matters, and for my thus prying into the secrets
of their iniquity.&nbsp; But to such I would say, since such
actions are evil, &rsquo;tis time they were hissed out of the
world.&nbsp; For all that doe such things, offend against God,
wrong their neighbour, and like Mr. Badman doe provoke God to
Judgment.&nbsp; God knows, there is abundance of deceit in the
world!</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Deceit!&nbsp; Aie, but I have not told you the
thousandth part of it; nor is it my business now to rake to the
bottom of that dunghill: what would you say, if I should
anatomize some of those vile wretches called Pawn-Brokers, that
lend Money and Goods to poor people, who are by necessity forced
to such an inconvenience; and will make, by one trick or other,
the Interest of what they so lend, amount to thirty, forty, yea
sometimes fifty pound by the year; nothwithstanding the Principal
is secured by a sufficient pawn; which they will keep too at
last, if they can find any shift to cheat the wretched
borrower.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Say!&nbsp; Why such Miscreants are the pest and
Vermin of the Common-Wealth, not fit for the society of men; but
methinks by some of those things you Discoursed before, you seem
to import that it is not lawful for a man to make the best of his
own.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; If by making the best, you mean, to sell for as
much as by hook or crook he can get for his comodity; then I say,
it is not lawful.&nbsp; And if I should say the contrary, I
should justifie Mr. Badman and all the rest of that Gang: but
that I never shall doe, for the Word of God condemns them.&nbsp;
But that it is not lawful for a man at all times, to sell his
commodity for as much as he can, I prove by these reasons. <a
name="citation118a"></a><a href="#footnote118a"
class="citation">[118a]</a></p>
<p>First, If it be lawful for me alway to sell my commodity as
dear, or for as much as I can, then &rsquo;tis lawful for me to
lay aside in my dealing with others, good conscience, to them,
and to God: but it is not lawful for me, in my dealing with
others, to lay aside good conscience, &amp;c.&nbsp; Therefore it
is not lawful for me always to sell my commodity as dear, or for
as much as I can.</p>
<p>That <a name="citation118b"></a><a href="#footnote118b"
class="citation">[118b]</a> it is not lawful to lay aside good
conscience in our dealings, has already been proved in the former
part of our discourse: but that a man must lay it aside that will
sell his commodity always as dear or for as much as he can, is
plainly manifest thus.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; He that will (as is mentioned afore) sell his
commodity as dear as he can, must sometimes make a prey of the
ignorance of his chapman: <a name="citation118c"></a><a
href="#footnote118c" class="citation">[118c]</a> but that he
cannot doe with a good conscience (for that is to overreach, and
to goe beyond my chapman, and is forbidden, 1 Thess. 4. 6.)&nbsp;
Therefore he that will sell his commodity, as afore, as dear, or
for as much as he can, must of necessity lay aside good
conscience.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; He that will sell his commodity always as dear as he
can, must needs, sometimes make a prey of his neighbours
necessity; <a name="citation118d"></a><a href="#footnote118d"
class="citation">[118d]</a> but that he cannot doe with a good
conscience, (for that is to goe beyond and defraud his neighbour,
contrary to 1 Thess. 4. 6.)&nbsp; Therefore he that will sell his
commodity, as afore, as dear, or for as much as he can, must
needs cast off and lay aside a good conscience.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; He that will (as afore) sell his commodity as dear,
or for as much as he can, must, if need be, make a prey of his
neighbours fondness; but that a man cannot doe with a good
conscience, <a name="citation119a"></a><a href="#footnote119a"
class="citation">[119a]</a> (for that is still a going beyond
him, contrary to 1 Thess. 4. 6.)&nbsp; Therefore, he that will
sell his commodity as dear, or for as much as he can, must needs
cast off, and lay aside good conscience.</p>
<p>The same also may be said for buying; no man may always buy as
cheap as he can, but must also use good conscience in buying; <a
name="citation119b"></a><a href="#footnote119b"
class="citation">[119b]</a> The which he can by no means use and
keep, if he buyes always as cheap as he can, and that for the
reasons urged before.&nbsp; For such will make a prey of the
ignorance, necessity, and fondness of their chapman, the which
they cannot doe with a good consceince.</p>
<p>When Abraham would buy a Burying-place of the Sons of Heth,
thus he said unto them.&nbsp; Intreat for me to Ephron the son of
Zohar, that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath,
in the end his field.&nbsp; For as much as it is worth shall he
give it me.&nbsp; Gen. 23. 8, 9. <a name="citation119c"></a><a
href="#footnote119c" class="citation">[119c]</a>&nbsp; He would
not have it under foot, he scorned it, he abhored it: It stood
not with his Religion, Credit, nor Conscience.&nbsp; So also when
David, would buy a field of Ornon the Jebusite: Thus he said unto
him: Grant me the place the threshing-floor, that I may build an
Altar there unto the Lord.&nbsp; Thou shalt give it me for the
full price. <a name="citation119d"></a><a href="#footnote119d"
class="citation">[119d]</a>&nbsp; He also, as Abraham, made
conscience of this kind of dealing: he would not lie at catch to
go beyond, no not the Jebusite, but will give him his full price
for his field.&nbsp; For he knew that there was wickedness, as in
selling too dear so in buying too cheap, therefore he would not
do it.</p>
<p>There ought therefore to be good conscience used, as in
selling, so in buying; for &rsquo;tis also unlawful for a man to
goe beyond or to defraud his neighbour in buying; yea &rsquo;tis
unlawful to doe it in any matter, and God will plentifully avenge
that wrong: as I also before have forewarned and testified.&nbsp;
See also the <a name="citation119e"></a><a href="#footnote119e"
class="citation">[119e]</a> text in the margent.&nbsp; But,</p>
<p>Secondly, if it be lawful for me always to sell my commodity
as dear, or for as much as I can, then it is lawful for me to
deal with my neighbour without the use of <a
name="citation120a"></a><a href="#footnote120a"
class="citation">[120a]</a> charity: but it is not lawful for me
to lay aside, or to deal with my neighbour without the use of
charity, therefore it is not lawful for me always to sell my
commodity to my neighbour for as much as I can.&nbsp; A man in
dealing should as really design his Neighbours good, profit, and
advantage, as his own: For this is to exercise Charity in his
dealing.</p>
<p>That I should thus use, or exercise charity towards my
Neighbour in my buying and selling, &amp;c. with him, is evident
from the general command: [Let all your things be done in
charity:] <a name="citation120b"></a><a href="#footnote120b"
class="citation">[120b]</a>&nbsp; But that a man cannot live in
the exercise of charity, that selleth, as afore, as dear, or that
buyeth as cheap as he can, is evident by these reasons.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; He that sells his commodity as dear, or for as much
money (always) as he can, seeks himself, and himself only; (but
charity seeketh not her own, nor her own only <a
name="citation120c"></a><a href="#footnote120c"
class="citation">[120c]</a>:)&nbsp; So then, he that seeks
himself, and himself onely, as he that sells (as afore) as dear
as he can, does; maketh not use of, nor doth he exercise charity,
in his so dealing.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; He that selleth his commodity (always) for as much as
he can get, hardeneth his heart against all reasonable entreaties
of the buyer.&nbsp; But he that doth so, cannot exercise charity
in his dealing; therefore it is not lawful for a man to sell his
commodity, as afore, as dear as he can.</p>
<p>Thirdly, If it be lawful for me to sell my commodity, as
afore, as dear as I can, then there can be no sin in my Trading,
how unreasonably soever I manage my calling, whether by Lying,
Swearing, Cursing, Cheating; for all this is but to sell my
commodity as dear as I can: but that there is sin in these, is
evident, therefore I may not sell my commodity always as dear as
I can. <a name="citation120d"></a><a href="#footnote120d"
class="citation">[120d]</a> <a name="citation120e"></a><a
href="#footnote120e" class="citation">[120e]</a></p>
<p>Fourthly, He that sells, as afore, as dear as he can, offereth
violence to the law of Nature: <a name="citation121b"></a><a
href="#footnote121b" class="citation">[121b]</a> for that saith,
Doe unto all men, even as ye would that they should doe unto you.
<a name="citation121a"></a><a href="#footnote121a"
class="citation">[121a]</a>&nbsp; Now, was the Seller a Buyer, he
would not that he of whom he buyes, should sell him always as
dear as he can; therefore he should not sell so himself, when it
is his lot to sell, and others to buy of him.</p>
<p>Fifthly, He that selleth, as afore, as dear as he can, makes
use of that instruction, that God hath not given to others, but
sealed up in his hand, <a name="citation121c"></a><a
href="#footnote121c" class="citation">[121c]</a> to abuse his
Law, and to wrong his neighbour withall: which indeed is contrary
to God. <a name="citation121d"></a><a href="#footnote121d"
class="citation">[121d]</a>&nbsp; God hath given thee more skill,
more knowledge and understanding in thy commodity than he hath
given to him that would buy of thee.&nbsp; But what! canst thou
think, that God has given thee this, that thou mightest thereby
make a prey of thy neighbour? that thou mightest thereby goe
beyond and beguile thy neighbour?&nbsp; No, verily; but he hath
given thee it, for his help; that thou mightest in this, be eyes
to the blind, and save thy neighbour from that dammage, that his
ignorance, or necessity, or fondness would betray him into the
hands of.</p>
<p>Sixthly, In all that a man does, he should have an eye to the
glory of God, <a name="citation121e"></a><a href="#footnote121e"
class="citation">[121e]</a> but that he cannot have that sells
his commodity always for as much as he can, for the reasons urged
before.</p>
<p>Seventhly, All that a man does, he should doe in the Name of
the Lord Jesus Christ; <a name="citation121f"></a><a
href="#footnote121f" class="citation">[121f]</a> that is, as
being commanded, and authorized to doe it by him: but he that
selleth always as dear as he can, cannot so much as pretend to
this, without horrid blaspheming of that Name, because commanded
by him to doe otherwise.</p>
<p>Eightly, and lastly, In all that a man does, he should have an
eye to the day of Judgment, and to the consideration of how his
actions will be esteemed of in that day. <a
name="citation121g"></a><a href="#footnote121g"
class="citation">[121g]</a>&nbsp; Therefore there is not any man
can or ought to sell always as dear as he can: unless he will,
yea he must say, in so doing, I will run the hazard of the tryal
of that day, If thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest
ought of thy neighbour, ye shall not oppress one another. <a
name="citation122a"></a><a href="#footnote122a"
class="citation">[122a]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But why doe you put in those cautionary
words?&nbsp; They must not sell [always] as dear, nor buy
[always] as cheap as they can: doe you not thereby intimate that
a man may sometimes do so?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I doe indeed intimate that somtimes the seller may
sell as dear, and the buyer buy as cheap as he can; but this is
allowable only in these cases: When he that sells is a Knave, and
lays aside all good conscience in selling; or when the buyer is a
Knave, and layes aside all good conscience in buying.&nbsp; If
the buyer therefore lights of a Knave, or if the seller lights of
a Knave, then let them look to themselves: but yet so, as not to
lay aside conscience, because he that thou dearest with doth so:
but how vile or base soever the chapman is, do thou keep thy
commodity at a reasonable price: or if thou buyest, offer
reasonable gain for the thing thou wouldest have: and if this
will not do with the buyer or seller, then seek thee a more
honest chapman: If thou objectest, But I have not skil to know
when a pennyworth is before me: Get some that have more skill
than thy self in that affair, and let them in that matter dispose
of thy money.&nbsp; But if there were no Knaves in the world,
these objections need not be made.</p>
<p>And thus, my very good neighbour, have I given you a few of my
reasons, why a man that hath it, should not always sell too dear,
nor buy as cheap as he can: but should use good Conscience to
God, and Charity to his Neighbour in both.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But were some men here, to hear you, I believe
they would laugh you to scorn.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I question not that at all, for so, <a
name="citation122b"></a><a href="#footnote122b"
class="citation">[122b]</a> Mr. Badman used to doe, when any man
told him of his faults: he used to think himself wiser than any,
and would count, as I have hinted before, that he was not arrived
to a manly spirit that did stick or boggle at any
wickedness.&nbsp; But let Mr. Badman and his fellowes laugh, I
will bear it, and still give them good counsel.&nbsp; But I will
remember also, for my further relief and comfort, that thus they
that were covetous of old, served the Son of God himself.&nbsp;
It is their time to laugh now, that they may mourn in time to
come. <a name="citation122c"></a><a href="#footnote122c"
class="citation">[122c]</a>&nbsp; And, I say again, when they
have laughed out their laugh; He that useth not good conscience
to God, and charity to his neighbour, in buying and selling,
dwells next dore to an Infidel, and is near of kin to Mr.
Badman.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but what will you say to this question? <a
name="citation123a"></a><a href="#footnote123a"
class="citation">[123a]</a> (you know that there is no settled
price set by God upon any Commodity that is bought or sold under
the Sun; but all things that we buy and sell, do ebbe and flow,
as to price, like the Tide:)&nbsp; How (then) shall a man of a
tender conscience doe, neither to wrong the seller, buyer, nor
himself, in buying and selling of commodities?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; This Question is thought to be frivolous by all
that are of Mr. Badmans way; &rsquo;tis also difficult in it
self: yet I will endeavour to shape you an Answer, <a
name="citation123b"></a><a href="#footnote123b"
class="citation">[123b]</a> and that first to the matter of the
question; to wit, How a Tradesman should, in Trading, keep a good
conscience; (A buyer or seller either.)&nbsp; Secondly, How he
should prepare himself to this work, and live in the practice of
it.</p>
<p>For the first: He <a name="citation123c"></a><a
href="#footnote123c" class="citation">[123c]</a> must observe
what hath been said before, to wit, he must have conscience to
God, charity to his neighbour; and I will add, much moderation in
dealing.&nbsp; Let him therefore keep within the bounds of the
affirmative of those eight reasons that before were urged to
prove, that men ought not in their Dealing, but to do Justly and
mercifully &rsquo;twixt man and man; and then there will be no
great fear of wronging the seller, buyer, or himself.</p>
<p>But particularly to prepare, or instruct a man to this
work:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Let the Tradesman or others consider, that there is
not that in great Gettings, and in abundance, which the most of
men do suppose: For all that a man has over and above what serves
for his present necessity and supply, serves only to feed the
lusts of the eye.&nbsp; For what good is there to the owners
thereof, save the beholding of them with their eyes? <a
name="citation123d"></a><a href="#footnote123d"
class="citation">[123d]</a>&nbsp; Men also, many times, in
getting of riches, get therewith a snare to their soul: <a
name="citation123e"></a><a href="#footnote123e"
class="citation">[123e]</a> But few get good by getting of
them.&nbsp; But this consideration, Mr. Badman could not
abide.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Consider, that the getting of wealth dishonestly (as
he does, that getteth it without good conscience and charity to
his neighbour,) is a great offender against God.&nbsp; Hence he
says, I have smitten mine hands at thy dishonest gain, which thou
hast made. <a name="citation124a"></a><a href="#footnote124a"
class="citation">[124a]</a>&nbsp; It is a manner of speech that
shews anger in the very making of mention of the Crime.&nbsp;
Therefore,</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Consider, that a little honestly gotten, though it
may yield thee but a dinner of herbs at a time, will yield more
peace therewith, than will a stalled Ox, ill gotten.&nbsp; Better
is a little with righteousness, than great revenues without
right. <a name="citation124b"></a><a href="#footnote124b"
class="citation">[124b]</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Be thou confident, that Gods eyes are upon all thy
wayes, and that he pondereth all thy goings, and also that he
marks them, writes them down, and seals them up in a bag, against
the time to come. <a name="citation124c"></a><a
href="#footnote124c" class="citation">[124c]</a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Be thou sure that thou remembrest, that thou knowest
not the day of thy death.&nbsp; Remember also, that when death
comes, God will give thy substance, for the which thou hast
laboured, and for the which perhaps thou hast hazarded thy soul,
to one, thou knowest not who, nor whether he shall be a wise man
or a fool.&nbsp; And then, what profit hath he that laboureth for
the wind? <a name="citation124d"></a><a href="#footnote124d"
class="citation">[124d]</a></p>
<p>Besides, thou shalt have nothing that thou mayest so much as
carry away in thine hand.&nbsp; Guilt shall goe with thee, if
thou hast got it dishonestly, and they also to whom thou shalt
leave it, shall receive it to their hurt.</p>
<p>These things duly considered, and made use of by thee to the
preparing of thy heart to thy calling of buying or selling; I
come in the next place to shew thee how thou shouldest live in
the practick part of this art.&nbsp; Art thou to buy or sell?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; If thou sellest, do not commend; if thou buyest, do
not dispraise, any otherwise, but to give the thing that thou
hast to do with, its just value and worth; for thou canst not do
otherwise knowingly, but of a covetous and wicked mind.&nbsp;
Wherefore else are comodities over-valued by the Seller, and also
under-valued by the Buyer.&nbsp; It is naught, it is naught, says
the buyer, but when he hath got his bargain he boasteth thereof.
<a name="citation124e"></a><a href="#footnote124e"
class="citation">[124e]</a>&nbsp; What hath this man done now but
lyed in the dispraising of his bargain? and why did he dispraise
it, but of a covetous mind, to wrong and beguile the seller?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Art thou a seller, and do things grow dear? set not
thy hand to help, or hold them up higher; this cannot be done
without wickedness neither; for this is a making of the sheckle
great: <a name="citation125a"></a><a href="#footnote125a"
class="citation">[125a]</a> Art thou a buyer, and do things grow
dear? use no cunning or deceitful language to pull them down: for
that cannot be done but wickedly too.&nbsp; What then shall we
do? will you say.&nbsp; Why I answer: Leave things to the
providence of God, and do thou with moderation submit to his
hand.&nbsp; But since, when they are growing dear, the hand that
upholds the price, is, for the time, more strong than that which
would pull it down; That being the hand of the seller, who loveth
to have it dear, specially if it shall rise in his hand:
therefore I say, do thou take heed, and have not a hand in
it.&nbsp; The which thou mayest have to thine own and thy
neighbours hurt, these three ways:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; By crying out scarcity, scarcity, beyond the truth
and state of things: especially take heed of doing of this by way
of a prognostick for time to come.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas for <a
name="citation125b"></a><a href="#footnote125b"
class="citation">[125b]</a> this for which he was trodden to
death in the gate of Samaria, that you read of in the book of
Kings.&nbsp; This sin has a double evil in it.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; It
belieth the present blessing of God amongst us: and, 2.&nbsp; It
undervalueth the riches of his goodness, which can make all good
things to abound towards us.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; This wicked thing may be done by hoarding up, when
the hunger and Necessity of the poor calls for it.&nbsp; Now that
God may shew his dislike against this, he doth, as it were,
license the people to curse such an hoarder up.&nbsp; He that
withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him, but blessing shall
be upon the head of him that selleth it. <a
name="citation125c"></a><a href="#footnote125c"
class="citation">[125c]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But if things will rise, do thou be grieved; Be also
moderate in all thy sellings, and be sure let the poor have a
pennyworth, and sell thy Corn to those in necessity: <a
name="citation125d"></a><a href="#footnote125d"
class="citation">[125d]</a> Which then thou wilt do, when thou
shewest mercy to the poor in thy selling to him, and when thou
for his sake, because he is poor, undersellest the market.&nbsp;
This is to buy and sell with good conscience: thy buyer thou
wrongest not, thy Conscience thou wrongest not, thy self thou
wrongest not, for God will surely recompense thee.</p>
<p>I have spoken concerning Corn, but thy duty is, to let thy
moderation in all things be known unto all men, the Lord is at
hand. <a name="citation125e"></a><a href="#footnote125e"
class="citation">[125e]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, Sir, now I have heard enough of Mr. Badmans
naughtiness, pray now proceed to his Death.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why Sir, the Sun is not so low, we have yet three
hours to night.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Nay; I am not in any great hast, but I thought
you had even now done with his Life.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Done! no, I have yet much more to say.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Then he has much more wickedness than I thought
he had.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; That may be.&nbsp; But let us proceed: This Mr.
Badman, added to all his wickedness this, He was a very proud
man, a Very proud man. <a name="citation126a"></a><a
href="#footnote126a" class="citation">[126a]</a>&nbsp; He was
exceeding proud and haughty in mind; He looked, that what he
said, ought not, must not be contradicted or opposed.&nbsp; He
counted himself as wise as the wisest in the Countrey, as good as
the best, and as beautiful as he that had most of it.&nbsp; He
took great delight in praising of himself, and as much in the
praises that others gave him.&nbsp; He could not abide that any
should think themselves above him, or that their wit or personage
should by others be set before his. <a name="citation126b"></a><a
href="#footnote126b" class="citation">[126b]</a>&nbsp; He had
scarce a fellowly carriage for his equals.&nbsp; But for those
that were of an inferior ranck, he would look over them in great
contempt.&nbsp; And if at any time he had any remote occasion of
having to do with them, he would shew great height, and a very
domineering spirit.&nbsp; So that in this it may be said that
Solomon gave a characteristical note of him, when he said: Proud
and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath. <a
name="citation126c"></a><a href="#footnote126c"
class="citation">[126c]</a>&nbsp; He never thought his Dyet well
enough dressed, his Cloathes fine enough made, or his Praise
enough refined.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This Pride, is a sin that sticks as close to
nature I think, as most sins.&nbsp; There is Uncleanness and
Pride, I know not of any two gross sins that stick closer to men
then they.&nbsp; They have, as I may call it, an interest in
Nature; it likes them because they most suit its lusts and
fancies: and therefore no marvel though Mr. Badman was tainted
with pride, since he had so wickedly given up himself to work all
iniquity with greediness.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You say right; Pride, is a sin that sticks close
to Nature, <a name="citation126d"></a><a href="#footnote126d"
class="citation">[126d]</a> and is one of the first follies
wherein it shews it self to be polluted.&nbsp; For even in
Childhood, even in little children, Pride will first of all shew
it self; it is a hasty, an early appearance of the sin of the
soul.&nbsp; It, as I may say, is that corruption that strives for
predominancy in the heart, and therefore usually comes out
first.&nbsp; But though children are so incident to it, yet
methinks those of more years, should be ashamed thereof.&nbsp; I
might at the first have begun with Mr. Badmans Pride, only I
think it is not the Pride in Infancy, that begins to make a
difference betwixt one and another, as did, and do those
wherewith I began my relation of his life: therefore I passed it
over, but now, since he had no more consideration of himself, and
of his vile and sinful state, but to be proud when come to years;
I have taken the occasion in this place to make mention of his
pride.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But pray, if you can remember them, tell me of
some places of Scripture that speak against pride.&nbsp; I the
rather desire this, because that pride is now a reigning sin, and
I happen sometimes to fall into the company of them that in my
conscience are proud, very much, and I have a mind also to tell
them of their sin; now when I tell them of it, unless I bring
Gods word too, I doubt they will laugh me to scorn.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Laugh you to scorn! the Proud man will laugh you
to scorn, bring to him what Text you can, except God shall smite
him in his conscience by the Word: Mr. Badman did use to serve
them so that did use to tell him of his: and besides, when you
have said what you can, they will tell you they are not proud,
and that you are rather the proud man, else you would not judge,
nor so malapertly meddle with other mens matters as you do.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, since you desire it, I will mention two or three
texts: They are these.&nbsp; Pride and arrogancy do I hate.&nbsp;
A mans pride shall bring him low.&nbsp; And he shall bring down
their pride.&nbsp; And all the proud, and all that do wickedly
shall be as stubble, and the day that comes shall burn them up.
<a name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127"
class="citation">[127]</a>&nbsp; This last, is a dreadful Text;
it is enough to make a proud man shake: God, saith he, will make
the proud ones as stubble; that is, as fuel for the fire, and the
day that cometh shall be like a burning oven, and that day shall
burn them up, saith the Lord.&nbsp; But Mr. Badman could never
abide to hear pride spoken against, nor that any should say of
him, He is a proud man.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; What should be the reason of that?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; He did not tell me the reason; but I suppose it to
be that which is common to all vile persons.&nbsp; They love this
Vice, but care not to bear its name. <a
name="citation128a"></a><a href="#footnote128a"
class="citation">[128a]</a>&nbsp; The Drunkard loves the sin, but
loves not to be called a drunkard.&nbsp; The Thief loveth to
steal, but cannot abide to be called a thief, the whore loveth to
commit uncleanness, but loveth not to be called a Whore; And so
Mr. Badman loved to be proud, but could not abide to be called a
proud man.&nbsp; The sweet of sin, is desirable to polluted and
corrupted man, but the name thereof, is a blot in his
Scutcheon.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true that you have said: but pray how
many sorts of pride are there?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; There are two sorts of Pride; <a
name="citation128b"></a><a href="#footnote128b"
class="citation">[128b]</a> Pride of Spirit, and Pride of
Body.&nbsp; The first of these is thus made mention of in the
Scriptures.&nbsp; Every one that is proud in heart is abomination
to the Lord. <a name="citation128c"></a><a href="#footnote128c"
class="citation">[128c]</a>&nbsp; A high look, and a proud heart,
and the plowing of the wicked is sin.&nbsp; The patient in spirit
is better than the proud in spirit.&nbsp; Bodily pride these
Scriptures mention.&nbsp; In that day the Lord shall take away
the bravery of their tinckling ornaments about their feet, and
their cauls, and their round tires like the Moon, the chains, and
the bracelets, and the mufflers, the bonnets, and the ornaments
of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the
ear-rings, the rings, and the Nose-jewels: <a
name="citation128d"></a><a href="#footnote128d"
class="citation">[128d]</a> The changable suits of Apparell, and
the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, the glasses,
and the fine linnen, and the hoods and the vails.&nbsp; By these
expressions it is evident that there is Pride of Body, as well as
Pride of Spirit, and that both are sin, and so abominable to the
Lord.&nbsp; But these Texts Mr. Badman could never abide to read,
they were to him as Micaiah was to Ahab, they never spake good of
him, but evil.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I suppose that it was not Mr. Badmans case alone
even to maligne those Texts that speak against their vices: For I
believe, that most ungodly men, (where the Scriptures are) have a
secret antipathy against those words of God that do most plainly
and fully rebuke them for their sins. <a
name="citation128e"></a><a href="#footnote128e"
class="citation">[128e]</a></p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; That is out of doubt, and by that antipathy, they
shew, that sin and Satan are more welcome to them than are the
wholesome instructions of life and godliness.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but not to goe off from our discourse of
Mr. Badman.&nbsp; You say he was proud: but will you shew me now
some symptoms of one that is proud?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes, that I will: And first I will shew you some
symptoms of Pride of Heart. <a name="citation129a"></a><a
href="#footnote129a" class="citation">[129a]</a>&nbsp; Pride of
heart, is seen by outward things, as Pride of Body in general, is
a sign of pride of heart; for all proud gestures of the body flow
from Pride of heart: therefore Solomon saith; There is a
generation, O how lofty are their eyes, and their eye-lids are
lifted up: <a name="citation129b"></a><a href="#footnote129b"
class="citation">[129b]</a> And again; There is that exalteth
their gate, their going. <a name="citation129c"></a><a
href="#footnote129c" class="citation">[129c]</a>&nbsp; Now these
lofty eyes, and this exalting of the gate, is a sign of a Proud
heart: for both these actions come from the heart: for out of the
heart comes Pride, in all the visible appearances of it. <a
name="citation129d"></a><a href="#footnote129d"
class="citation">[129d]</a>&nbsp; But more particularly:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Heart Pride is discovered <a
name="citation129e"></a><a href="#footnote129e"
class="citation">[129e]</a> by a stretched out Neck, and by
mincing as they go.&nbsp; For the wicked, the Proud, have a proud
Neck, a proud Foot, a proud Tongue, by which this their going is
exalted.&nbsp; This is that which makes them look scornfully,
speak ruggedly, and carry it huffingly among their
Neighbours.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A proud heart, is a persecuting one: The wicked
through his pride doth persecute the poor. <a
name="citation129f"></a><a href="#footnote129f"
class="citation">[129f]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; A prayerless man is a proud man. <a
name="citation129g"></a><a href="#footnote129g"
class="citation">[129g]</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; A contentious man is a proud man. <a
name="citation129h"></a><a href="#footnote129h"
class="citation">[129h]</a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The disdainful man is a proud man. <a
name="citation129i"></a><a href="#footnote129i"
class="citation">[129i]</a></p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The man that oppresses his neighbour is a proud man.
<a name="citation129j"></a><a href="#footnote129j"
class="citation">[129j]</a></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; He that hearkeneth not to Gods Word with reverence
and fear, is a proud man. <a name="citation129k"></a><a
href="#footnote129k" class="citation">[129k]</a></p>
<p>8.&nbsp; And he that calls the proud happy, is, be sure, a
proud man.&nbsp; All these are proud in heart, and this their
pride of heart doth thus discover it self. <a
name="citation129l"></a><a href="#footnote129l"
class="citation">[129l]</a> <a name="citation129m"></a><a
href="#footnote129m" class="citation">[129m]</a></p>
<p>As to bodily <a name="citation129n"></a><a
href="#footnote129n" class="citation">[129n]</a> pride, it is
discovered, that is, something of it, by all the particulars
mentioned before; for though they are said to be symptoms of
pride of heart, yet they are symptoms of that pride, by their
shewing of themselves in the Body.&nbsp; You know diseases that
are within, are seen oft-times by outward and visible Signs, yet
by them very signs even the outside is defiled also.&nbsp; So all
those visible signs of heart-pride, are signs of bodily pride
also.&nbsp; But to come to more outward signs: The putting on of
Gold, and Pearls, and costly array; the pleating of the hair, the
following of fashions, the seeking by gestures to imitate the
proud, either by speech, looks, dresses, goings, or other fools
baubles, (of which at this time the world is full) all these, and
many more, are signs, as of a proud heart, so of bodily pride
also. <a name="citation130b"></a><a href="#footnote130b"
class="citation">[130b]</a></p>
<p>But Mr. Badman would not allow, by any means, that this should
be called Pride, <a name="citation130c"></a><a
href="#footnote130c" class="citation">[130c]</a> but rather
neatness, handsomness, comeliness, cleanliness, &amp;c. neither
would he allow that following of fashions was any thing else, but
because he would not be proud, singular, and esteemed fantastical
by his neighbours.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But I have been told, that when some have been
rebuked for their pride, they have turned it again upon the
brotherhood of those by whom they have been rebuked: saying,
Physician heal thy Friends, look at home, among your Brotherhood,
even among the wisest of you, and see if you your selves be
clear, even you professors: for who is prouder than you
professors? scarcesly the Devil himself.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; My heart akes at this answer, because there is too
much cause for it. <a name="citation130d"></a><a
href="#footnote130d" class="citation">[130d]</a>&nbsp; This very
Answer would Mr. Badman give his wife, when she (as she would
sometimes) reproved him for his pride: We shall have, says he,
great amendments in living now, for the Devil is turned a
corrector of vice: For no sin reigneth more in the world, quoth
he, than pride among professors.&nbsp; And who can contradict
him? let us give the Devil his due, the thing is too apparent for
any man to deny.</p>
<p>And I doubt not but the same answer is ready in the mouths of
Mr. Badmans friends; for they may and do see pride display it
self in the Apparel and carriages of professors; one may say,
almost as much, as among any people in the Land, the more is the
pity.&nbsp; Ay, and I fear that even their Extravagancies in
this, hath hardened the heart of many a one, as I perceive it did
somewhat the heart of Mr. Badman himself.</p>
<p>For mine own part, I have seen many my self, and those
Church-members too, so deckt and bedaubed with their Fangles and
Toyes, and that when they have been at the solemn Appointments of
God, in the way of his Worship, that I have wondred with what
face such painted persons could sit in the place where they were
without swounding.&nbsp; But certainly the holiness of God, and
also the pollution of themselves by sin, must needs be very far
out of the minds of such people, what profession soever they
make.</p>
<p>I have read of an Whores forehead, <a
name="citation131a"></a><a href="#footnote131a"
class="citation">[131a]</a> and I have read of
christian-shamefacedness; I have read of costly array, and of
that which becometh women professing Godliness, with good works;
<a name="citation131b"></a><a href="#footnote131b"
class="citation">[131b]</a> <a name="citation131c"></a><a
href="#footnote131c" class="citation">[131c]</a> but if I might
speak, I know what I know, and could say, and yet do no wrong,
that which would make some professors stink in their places; <a
name="citation131d"></a><a href="#footnote131d"
class="citation">[131d]</a> but now I forbear.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Sir, you seem to be greatly concerned at this,
but what I shall say more? it is whispered, that some good
Ministers have countenanced their people in their light and
wanton Apparrel, yea have pleaded for their Gold, and Pearls, and
costly array, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I know not what they have pleaded for, but
&rsquo;tis easily seen that they tolerate, or at least wise, wink
and connive at such things, both in their Wives and
Children.&nbsp; And so from the Prophets of Jerusalem is
profaneness gone forth into all the land. <a
name="citation131e"></a><a href="#footnote131e"
class="citation">[131e]</a>&nbsp; And when the hand of the Rulers
are chief in a trespass, who can keep their people from being
drowned in that trespass?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This is a lamentation, and must stand for a
lamentation.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; So it is, and so it must.&nbsp; And I will add, it
is a shame, it is a reproach, it is a stumbling-block to the
blind; <a name="citation131f"></a><a href="#footnote131f"
class="citation">[131f]</a> for though men be as blind as Mr.
Badman himself, yet they can see the foolish lightness that must
needs be the bottom of all these apish and wanton
extravagancies.&nbsp; But many have their excuses ready; to wit,
their Parents, their Husbands, and their breeding calls for it,
and the like: yea, the examples of good people prompt them to it:
but all these will be but the Spiders webb, when the thunder of
the Word of the great God shall rattle from Heaven against them,
as it will at Death or Judgment; but I wish it might do it
before.&nbsp; But alas! these excuses are but bare pretences,
these proud ones love to have it so.&nbsp; I once talked with a
Maid, by way of reproof, for her fond and gaudy garment.&nbsp;
But she told me, 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>The Tailor would make it so: when alas, poor proud Girle, she
gave order to the Taylor so to make it.&nbsp; Many make Parents,
and Husbands, and Taylors, &amp;c. the Blind to others, but their
naughty hearts, and their giving of way thereto, that is the
original cause of all these evils.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Now you are speaking of the cause of pride, pray
shew me yet further why pride is now so much in request? <a
name="citation132b"></a><a href="#footnote132b"
class="citation">[132b]</a></p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I will shew you what I think are the reasons of
it.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The first is, <a name="citation132c"></a><a
href="#footnote132c" class="citation">[132c]</a> Because such
persons are led by their own hearts, rather than by the Word of
God.&nbsp; I told you before, that the original fountain of pride
is the heart.&nbsp; For out of the heart comes pride; it is
therefore because they are led by their hearts, which naturally
tends to lift them up in pride.&nbsp; This pride of heart, tempts
them, and by its deceits overcometh them; <a
name="citation132d"></a><a href="#footnote132d"
class="citation">[132d]</a> yea it doth put a bewitching vertue
into their Peacocks feathers, and then they are swallowed up with
the vanity of them.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Another reason why professors are so proud, (for
those we are talking of now) is because they are more apt to take
example of those that are of the World, than they are to take
example of those that are Saints indeed.&nbsp; Pride is of the
world.&nbsp; For all that is of the world, the lusts of the
flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, are not of
the Father but of the world. <a name="citation132e"></a><a
href="#footnote132e" class="citation">[132e]</a>&nbsp; Of the
world therefore Professors learn to be proud.&nbsp; But they
should not take them for example.&nbsp; It will be objected, No,
nor your saints neither, for you are as proud as others: Well,
let them take shame that are guilty.&nbsp; But when I say,
professors should take example for their life by those that are
saints indeed, I mean as Peter says: They should take example of
those that were in old time, the saints; for saints of old time
were the best, therefore to these he directeth us for our
pattern.&nbsp; Let the wives conversation be chast, and also
coupled with fear.&nbsp; Whose adorning, saith Peter, let it not
be that outward adorning, of pleating the hair, and of wearing of
gold, or of putting on of Apparel: but let it be the hidden man
of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament
of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great
price.&nbsp; For after this manner, in the old time, the holy
women also who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in
subjection to their own husbands. <a name="citation132f"></a><a
href="#footnote132f" class="citation">[132f]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Another reason is, <a name="citation133a"></a><a
href="#footnote133a" class="citation">[133a]</a> Because they
have forgotten the pollution of their Nature.&nbsp; For the
remembrance of that, must needs keep us humble, and being kept
humble, we shall be at a distance from pride.&nbsp; The proud and
the humble are set in opposition; (God resisteth the proud, but
giveth grace to the humble.)&nbsp; And can it be imagined, that a
sensible Christian should be a proud one; sence of baseness tends
to lay us low, not to lift us up with pride; not with pride of
Heart, nor pride of Life: But when a man begins to forget what he
is, then he, if ever, begins to be proud.</p>
<p>Methinks it is one of the most senceless and ridiculous things
in the world, that a man should be proud of that which is given
him on purpose to cover the shame of his nakedness with.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Persons that are proud, have gotten God and his
Holiness out of their sight. <a name="citation133b"></a><a
href="#footnote133b" class="citation">[133b]</a>&nbsp; If God was
before them, as he is behind their back; And if they saw him in
his holiness, as he sees them in their sins and shame, they would
take but little pleasure in their apish Knacks.&nbsp; The
Holiness of God makes the Angels cover their faces, crumbles
Christians, when they behold it, into dust and ashes: <a
name="citation133c"></a><a href="#footnote133c"
class="citation">[133c]</a> and as his Majesty is, such is his
Word; Therefore they abuse it, that bring it to countenance
pride.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a name="citation133d"></a><a href="#footnote133d"
class="citation">[133d]</a> But what can be the end of those that
are proud, in the decking of themselves after their antick
manner? why are they for going with their Bulls-foretops, with
their naked shoulders, and Paps hanging out like a Cows bag? why
are they for painting their faces, for stretching out their
necks, and for putting of themselves into all the Formalities
which proud Fancy leads them to?&nbsp; Is it because they would
honour God? because they would adorn the Gospel? because they
would beautifie Religion, and make sinners to fall in love with
their own salvation?&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; It is rather to please
their lusts, to satisfie their wild and extravagant fancies; and
I wish none doth it to stir up lust in others, to the end they
may commit uncleanness with them.&nbsp; I believe, whatever is
their end, this is one of the great designes of the Devil: and I
believe also, that Satan has drawn more into the sin of
uncleanness, by the spangling shew of fine cloaths, than he could
possibly have drawn unto it, without them.&nbsp; I wonder what it
was, that of old was called the Attire of an Harlot: certainly it
could not be more bewitching and tempting than are the garments
of many professors this day.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I like what you say very well, and I wish that
all the proud Dames in England that profess, were within the
reach and sound of your words.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; What I have said, I believe is true, but as for
the proud Dames in England that profess, they have Moses and the
Prophets, and if they will not hear them, how then can we hope
that they should recieve good by such a dull sounding Ramshorn as
I am?&nbsp; However, I have said my mind, and now if you will, we
will proceed to some other of Mr. Badmans doings.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; No: pray before you shew me any thing else of Mr.
Badman, shew me yet more particularly the evil effects of this
sin of Pride.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; With all my heart, I will answer your request. <a
name="citation134a"></a><a href="#footnote134a"
class="citation">[134a]</a></p>
<p>1. <a name="citation134b"></a><a href="#footnote134b"
class="citation">[134b]</a>&nbsp; Then: &rsquo;Tis pride that
makes poor Man so like the Devil in Hell, that he cannot in it be
known to be the Image and similitude of God.&nbsp; The Angels
when they became Devils, &rsquo;twas through their being lifted
or puffed up with pride.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis pride also that lifteth
or puffeth up the heart of the sinner, and so makes him to bear
the very image of the Devil.</p>
<p>2. <a name="citation134c"></a><a href="#footnote134c"
class="citation">[134c]</a>&nbsp; Pride makes a man so odious in
the sight of God, that he shall not, must not come nigh his
Majesty.&nbsp; Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect to
the lowly, but the proud he knows afar off.&nbsp; Pride sets God
and the Soul at a distrance; pride will not let a man come nigh
God, nor God will not let a proud man come nigh unto him: Now
this is a dreadful thing.</p>
<p>3. <a name="citation134d"></a><a href="#footnote134d"
class="citation">[134d]</a>&nbsp; As pride sets, so it keeps God
and the Soul at a distance.&nbsp; God resisteth the proud;
resists, that is, he opposes him, he thrusts him from him, he
contemneth his person and all his performances.&nbsp; Come in to
Gods Ordinances, the proud man may; but come into his presence,
have communion with him, or blessing from him, he shall
not.&nbsp; For the high God doth resist him. <a
name="citation135a"></a><a href="#footnote135a"
class="citation">[135a]</a></p>
<p>4. <a name="citation135b"></a><a href="#footnote135b"
class="citation">[135b]</a>&nbsp; The Word saith, that The Lord
will destroy the House of the proud.&nbsp; He will destroy his
House; it may be understood, he will destroy him and his.&nbsp;
So he destroyed proud Pharaoh, so he destroyed proud Corah, and
many others.</p>
<p>5. <a name="citation135c"></a><a href="#footnote135c"
class="citation">[135c]</a>&nbsp; Pride, where it comes, and is
entertained, is a certain forerunner of some Judgment that is not
far behind.&nbsp; When pride goes before, shame and destruction
will follow after.&nbsp; When pride cometh, then cometh
shame.&nbsp; Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit
before a fall.</p>
<p>6. <a name="citation135d"></a><a href="#footnote135d"
class="citation">[135d]</a>&nbsp; Persisting in pride makes the
condition of a poor man as remediless as is that of the Devils
themselves.</p>
<p>And this I fear was Mr. Badmans condition, and that was the
reason that he died so as he did; as I shall shew you anon.</p>
<p>But what need I thus talk of the particular actions, or rather
prodigious sins of Mr. Badman, when his whole Life and all his
actions, went as it were to the making up one massie body of sin?
<a name="citation135e"></a><a href="#footnote135e"
class="citation">[135e]</a>&nbsp; Instead of believing that there
was a God, his Mouth, his Life and Actions declared, that he
believed no such thing.&nbsp; His transgression said within my
heart, that there was no fear of God before his eyes. <a
name="citation135f"></a><a href="#footnote135f"
class="citation">[135f]</a> <a name="citation135g"></a><a
href="#footnote135g" class="citation">[135g]</a>&nbsp; Instead of
honouring of God, and of giving glory to him for any of his
Mercies, or under any of his good Providences towards him (for
God is good to all, and lets his Sun shine, and his Rain fall
upon the unthankful and unholy,) he would ascribe the glory to
other causes.&nbsp; If they were Mercies, he would ascribe them
(if the open face of the providence did not give him the lye) to
his own wit, labour, care, industry, cunning, or the like: if
they were Crosses, he would ascribe them, or count them the
offspring of Fortune, ill Luck, Chance, the ill mannagement of
matters, the ill will of neighbours, or to his wifes being
Religious, and spending, as he called it, too much time in
Reading, Praying, or the like.&nbsp; It was not in his way to
acknowledge God, (that is, graciously) or his hand in
things.&nbsp; But, as the Prophet saith; Let favour be skewed to
the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness. <a
name="citation136a"></a><a href="#footnote136a"
class="citation">[136a]</a>&nbsp; And again, They returned not to
him that smote them, nor did they seek the Lord of hosts. <a
name="citation136b"></a><a href="#footnote136b"
class="citation">[136b]</a>&nbsp; This was Mr. Badmans temper,
neither Mercies nor Judgment would make him seek the Lord.&nbsp;
Nay, as another Scripture sayes, he would not see the works of
God, nor regard the operations of his hands either in mercies or
in Judgments. <a name="citation136c"></a><a href="#footnote136c"
class="citation">[136c]</a>&nbsp; But further, when by Providence
he has been cast under the best Means for his soul, (for, as was
shewed before, he having had a good master, and before him a good
father, and after all a good wife, and being sometimes upon a
Journey, and cast under the hearing of a good Sermon, as he would
sometimes for novelties sake go to hear a good Preacher;) he was
always without heart to make use thereof: In this land of
righteousness he would deal unjustly, and would not behold the
majesty of the Lord.</p>
<p>Instead of reverencing the Word, <a name="citation136g"></a><a
href="#footnote136g" class="citation">[136g]</a> when he heard it
preached, read, or discoursed of, he would sleep, talk of other
Business, or else object against the authority, harmony, and
wisdom of the Scriptures.&nbsp; Saying, How do you know them to
be the Word of God? how do you know that these sayings are
true?&nbsp; The Scriptures, he would say, were as a Nose of Wax,
and a man may turn them whithersoever he lists: one Scripture
says one thing, and another sayes the quite contrary; Besides,
they make mention of a thousand imposibilities; they are the
cause of all dissensions and discords that are in the Land:
Therefore you may (would he say) still think what you will, but
in my mind they are best at ease that have least to do with
them.</p>
<p>Instead of loving and honouring of them that did bear in their
Foreheads the Name, and in their Lives the Image of Christ, they
should be his Song, <a name="citation136h"></a><a
href="#footnote136h" class="citation">[136h]</a> the matter of
his Jests, and the objects of his slanders.&nbsp; He would either
make a mock at their sober deportment, their gracious language,
quiet behaviour, or else desperately swear that they did all in
deceit and hypocrisie.&nbsp; He would endeavour to render godly
men as odious and contemptable as he could; any lyes that were
made by any, to their disgrace, those he would avouch for truth,
and would not endure to be controlled.&nbsp; He was much like
those that the prophet speaks of, that would sit and slander his
mothers son; <a name="citation137a"></a><a href="#footnote137a"
class="citation">[137a]</a> yea, he would speak reproachfully of
his wife, though his conscience told him, and many would
testifie, that she was a very vertuous woman.&nbsp; He would also
raise slanders of his wives friends himself, affirming that their
doctrine tended to lasciviousness, and that in their assemblies
they acted and did unbeseeming men and women, that they committed
uncleanness, &amp;c.&nbsp; He was much like those that affirmed
the Apostle should say, Let us do evil that good may come: <a
name="citation137b"></a><a href="#footnote137b"
class="citation">[137b]</a> Or like those of whom it is thus
written: Report, say they, and we will report it. <a
name="citation137c"></a><a href="#footnote137c"
class="citation">[137c]</a>&nbsp; And if he could get any thing
by the end that had scandal in it, if it did but touch
professors, how falsely soever reported; Oh! then he would glory,
laugh, and be glad, and lay it upon the whole party: Saying, Hang
them Rogues, there is not a barrel better Herring of all the holy
Brotherhood of them: Like to like, quoth the Devil to the
Collier, this is your precise Crew.&nbsp; And then he would send
all home with a curse.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; If those that make profession of Religion be
wise, Mr. Badmans watchings and words will make them the more
wary and careful in all things.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You say true.&nbsp; For when we see men do watch
for our halting, and rejoyce to see us stumble and fall, it
should make us so much abundance the more careful. <a
name="citation137d"></a><a href="#footnote137d"
class="citation">[137d]</a></p>
<p>I do think it was as delightful to Mr. Badman to hear, raise,
and tell lies, and lying stories of them that fear the Lord, as
it was for him to go to bed when a weary.&nbsp; But we will at
this time let these things pass.&nbsp; For as he was in these
things bad enough, so he added to these, many more the like.</p>
<p>He was an <a name="citation137e"></a><a href="#footnote137e"
class="citation">[137e]</a> angry, wrathfull, envious man, a man
that knew not what meekness or gentleness meant, nor did he
desire to learn.&nbsp; His natural temper was to be surly,
huffie, and rugged, and worse; and he so gave way to his temper,
as to this, that it brought him to be furious and outrageous in
all things, specially against goodness it self, and against other
things too, when he was displeased. <a name="citation138a"></a><a
href="#footnote138a" class="citation">[138a]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Solomon saith, He is a fool that rageth.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; He doth so; and sayes moreover, That anger rests
in the bosom of fools. <a name="citation138b"></a><a
href="#footnote138b" class="citation">[138b]</a>&nbsp; And truly,
if it be a sign of a Fool to have anger rest in his bosom, then
was Mr. Badman, notwithstanding the conceit that he had of his
own abilities, a Fool of no small size.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Fools are mostly most wise in their own eyes.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; True.&nbsp; But I was a saying, that if it be a
sign that a man is a Fool, when Anger rests in his bosom; Then
what is it a sign of, think you, when Malice and Envy rests
there?&nbsp; For to my knowledge Mr. Badman was as malicious and
as envious a man as commonly you can hear of.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Certainly, malice and envy flow <a
name="citation138c"></a><a href="#footnote138c"
class="citation">[138c]</a> from pride and arrogancy, and they
again from ignorance, and ignorance from the Devil; And I
thought, that since you spake of the pride of Mr. Badman before,
we should have something of these before we had done.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Envy flows from Ignorance indeed.&nbsp; And this
Mr. Badman was so envious an one, where he set against, that he
would swell with it, as a Toad, as we say, swells with
poyson.&nbsp; He whom he maligned, might at any time even read
envy in his face wherever he met with him, or in whatever he had
to do with him.</p>
<p>His envy was so rank and strong, that if it at any time turned
its head against a man, it would hardly ever be pulled in again:
He would watch over that man to do him mischief, as the Cat
watches over the Mouse to destroy it; yea, he would wait seven
years, but he would have an opportunity to hurt him, and when he
had it, he would make him feel the weight of his Envy.</p>
<p>Envy is a devilish thing, the Scripture intimates that none
can stand before it.&nbsp; A stone is heavy, and the sand
weighty, but a fools wrath is heavier than them both.&nbsp; Wrath
is cruel, and anger is outrageous, but who can stand before envy?
<a name="citation138d"></a><a href="#footnote138d"
class="citation">[138d]</a> <a name="citation138e"></a><a
href="#footnote138e" class="citation">[138e]</a></p>
<p>This Envy, for the foulness of it, is reckoned <a
name="citation138f"></a><a href="#footnote138f"
class="citation">[138f]</a> among the foulest Villanies that are,
as adultery, murder, drunkenness, revellings, witchcrafts,
heresies, seditions, &amp;c.&nbsp; Yea, it is so malignant a
corruption, that it rots the very bones of him in whom it
dwells.&nbsp; A sound heart is life to the flesh, but envy the
rottenness of the bones. <a name="citation139a"></a><a
href="#footnote139a" class="citation">[139a]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This Envy is the very Father and Mother of a
great many hideous and prodigious wickednesses: I say, it is the
very <a name="citation139b"></a><a href="#footnote139b"
class="citation">[139b]</a> Father and Mother of them; it both
besets them, and also nourishes them up, till they come to their
cursed maturity in the bosom of him that entertains them.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You have given it a very right description, in
calling of it the Father and Mother of a great many other
prodigious wickednesses: for it is so venomous and vile a thing,
that it puts the whole course of Nature out of order, and makes
it fit for nothing but confusion, and a hold for every evil
thing. For where envy and strife is, there is confusion, and
every evil work. <a name="citation139c"></a><a
href="#footnote139c" class="citation">[139c]</a>&nbsp; Wherefore,
I say, you have rightly called it, The very Father and Mother of
a great many other sins.&nbsp; And now for our further
edification, I will reckon up some of the births of Envy.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Envy, as I told you before, it rotteth the very bones
of him that entertains it.&nbsp; And, <a
name="citation139d"></a><a href="#footnote139d"
class="citation">[139d]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; As you have also hinted, it is heavier than a Stone,
than Sand; yea, and I will add, It falls like a Mill-stone upon
the head.&nbsp; Therefore,</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It kills him that throws it, and him at whom it is
thrown.&nbsp; Envy slayeth the silly one. <a
name="citation139e"></a><a href="#footnote139e"
class="citation">[139e]</a>&nbsp; That is, him in whom it
resides, and him who is its object.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas that also that slew Jesus Christ himself;
for his adversaries persecuted him through their envy. <a
name="citation139f"></a><a href="#footnote139f"
class="citation">[139f]</a> <a name="citation139g"></a><a
href="#footnote139g" class="citation">[139g]</a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Envy was that by vertue of which Joseph was sold by
his Brethren into Egypt: <a name="citation139h"></a><a
href="#footnote139h" class="citation">[139h]</a></p>
<p>6.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis envy that hath the hand in making of
variance among Gods Saints. <a name="citation139i"></a><a
href="#footnote139i" class="citation">[139i]</a></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis envy in the hearts of Sinners, that
stirres them up to thrust Gods Ministers out of their coasts.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; What shall I say?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis envy that is the
very Nursery of whisperings, debates, backbitings, slanders,
reproaches, murders, &amp;c.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis not possible to repeat all the particular fruits of
this sinfull root.&nbsp; Therefore, it is no marvel that Mr.
Badman was such an ill natured man, for the great roots of all
manner of wickedness were in him, unmortified, unmaimed,
untouched.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But it is <a name="citation140a"></a><a
href="#footnote140a" class="citation">[140a]</a> a rare case,
even this of Mr. Badman, that he should never in all his life be
touched with remorse for his ill-spent life.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Remorse, I cannot say he ever had, if by remorse
you mean repentance for his evils.&nbsp; Yet twice I remember he
was under some trouble of mind about his condition: <a
name="citation140b"></a><a href="#footnote140b"
class="citation">[140b]</a> Once when he broke his legg as he
came home drunk from the Ale-house; and another time when he fell
sick, and thought he should die: Besides these two times, I do
not remember any more.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Did he break his legg then?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes: Once, as he came home drunk from the
Ale-house.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray how did he break it?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why upon a time he was at an Ale-house, that
wicked house, about two or three miles from home, and having
there drank hard the greatest part of the day, when night was
come, he would stay no longer, but calls for his horse, gets up,
and like a Madman (as drunken persons usually ride) away he goes,
as hard as horse could lay legs to the ground.&nbsp; Thus he rid,
till coming to a dirty place, where his horse flouncing in, fell,
threw his master, and with his fall broke his legg: so there he
lay. <a name="citation140c"></a><a href="#footnote140c"
class="citation">[140c]</a>&nbsp; But you would not think how he
<a name="citation140d"></a><a href="#footnote140d"
class="citation">[140d]</a> swore at first.&nbsp; But after a
while, he comeing to himself, and feeling by his pain, and the
uselesness of his legg, what case he was in, and also fearing
that this bout might be his death; he began to crie out after the
manner of such; <a name="citation140e"></a><a
href="#footnote140e" class="citation">[140e]</a> Lord help me,
Lord have mercy upon me, good God deliver me, and the like.&nbsp;
So there he lay, till some came by, who took him up, carried him
home, where he lay for some time, before he could go abroad
again.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; And then, you say, he called upon God.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; He cryed out in his pain, and would say, O God,
and O Lord, help me: but whether it was that his sin might be
pardoned, and his soul saved, or whether to be rid of his pain, I
will not positively determine; though I fear it was but for the
last; <a name="citation141a"></a><a href="#footnote141a"
class="citation">[141a]</a> because, when his pain was gone, and
he had got hopes of mending, even before he could go abroad, he
cast off prayer, and began his old game; to wit, to be as bad as
he was before.&nbsp; He then would send for his old companions;
his Sluts also would come to his house to see him, and with them
he would be, as well as he could for his lame leg, as vicious as
they could be for their hearts.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a wonder he did not break his
neck.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; His neck had gone instead of his leg, but that God
was long-suffering towards him; he had deserved it ten thousand
times over.&nbsp; There have been many, as I have heard, and as I
have hinted to you before, that have taken their Horses when
drunk, as he; but they have gone from the pot to the grave; for
they have broken their necks &rsquo;twixt the Ale-house and
home.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=

</a>One hard by us also drunk himself dead; he drank, and dyed in
his drink.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a sad thing to dye drunk.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; So it is: But yet I wonder that no more do
so.&nbsp; For considering the heinousness of that sin, and with
how many other sins it is accompanied, <a
name="citation141c"></a><a href="#footnote141c"
class="citation">[141c]</a> as with oaths, blasphemies, lyes,
revellings, whoreings, brawlings, &amp;c. it is a wonder to me,
that any that live in that sin should escape such a blow from
heaven that should tumble them into their graves.&nbsp; Besides,
when I consider also how, when they are as drunk as beasts, they,
without all fear of danger, will ride like Bedlams and mad men,
even as if they did dare God to meddle with them if he durst, for
their being drunk: I say, I wonder that he doth not withdraw his
protecting providences from them, and leave them to those Dangers
and Destructions that by their sin they have deserved, and that
by their Bedlam madness they would rush themselves into: only I
consider again, that he has appointed a day wherein he will
reckon with them, <a name="citation141d"></a><a
href="#footnote141d" class="citation">[141d]</a> and doth also
commonly make Examples of some, to shew that he takes notice of
their sin, abhorrs their way, and will count with them for it at
the set time.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; It is worthy of our remark, to take notice how
God, to shew his dislike of the sins of men, strikes some of them
down with a blow; as the breaking of Mr. Badmans legg, for
doubtless that was a stroak from heaven.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It is worth our remark indeed.&nbsp; It was an
open stroak, it fell upon him while he was in the height of his
sin: And it looks much like to that in Job; Therefore he knoweth
their works, and overturneth them in the night, so that they are
destroyed.&nbsp; He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight
of others: <a name="citation142a"></a><a href="#footnote142a"
class="citation">[142a]</a> Or as the Margent reads it, in the
place of beholders.&nbsp; He layes them with his stroak in the
place of beholders.&nbsp; There was <a name="citation142b"></a><a
href="#footnote142b" class="citation">[142b]</a> Mr. Badman laid,
his stroak was taken notice of by every one: his broken legg was
at this time the Town-talk.&nbsp; Mr. Badman has broken his legg,
sayes one: How did he break it? sayes another: As he came home
drunk from such an Ale-house, said a third; A Judgment of God
upon him, said a fourth.&nbsp; This his sin, his shame, and
punishment, are all made conspicuous to all that are about
him.&nbsp; I will here tell you another story or two.</p>
<p>I have read in Mr. Clark&rsquo;s Looking-glass for Sinners; <a
name="citation142c"></a><a href="#footnote142c"
class="citation">[142c]</a> That upon a time, a certain drunken
fellow boasted in his Cups, that there was neither Heaven nor
Hell; also he said, He believed, that man had no Soul, and that
for his own part, he would sell his soul to any that would buy
it.&nbsp; Then did one of his companions buy it of him for a cup
of Wine; and presently the Devil in mans shape bought it of that
man again at the same price; and so in the presence of them all
laid hold on this Soul-seller, and carried him away through the
Air, so that he was never more heard of.</p>
<p>In pag. 148, he tells us also: That there was one at
Salisbury, in the midst of his health drinking and carousing in a
Tavern; and he drank a health to the Devil, saying, That if the
Devil would not come and pledge him, he would not believe that
there was either God or Devil.&nbsp; Whereupon his companions
stricken with fear, hastened out of the room: and presently
after, hearing a hideous noise, and smelling a stinking savour,
the Vintner ran up into the chamber; and coming in, he missed his
Guest, and found the window broken, the Iron barr in it bowed,
and all bloody: But the man was never heard of afterwards.</p>
<p>Again, in pag. 149. he tells us of a Bailiff of Hedly: Who
upon a Lords Day being drunk at Melford, got upon his horse, to
ride through the streets, saying, That his horse would carry him
to the Devil: and presently his horse threw him, and broke his
neck.&nbsp; These things are worse than the breaking of Mr.
Badmans Leg, and should be a caution to all of his friends that
are living, lest they also fall by their sin into these sad
Judgements of God.</p>
<p>But, as I said, Mr. Badman quickly forgot all, his conscience
was choaked, before his legg was healed.&nbsp; And therefore,
before he was well of the fruit of one sin, he tempts God to send
another Judgment to seize upon him: And so he did quickly
after.&nbsp; For not many months after his legg was well, he had
a very dangerous fit of sickness, insomuch that now he began to
think he must dye in very deed. <a name="citation143a"></a><a
href="#footnote143a" class="citation">[143a]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, and what did he think and do then?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; He thought he must go to Hell; this I know, for he
could not forbear but say so. <a name="citation143b"></a><a
href="#footnote143b" class="citation">[143b]</a>&nbsp; To my best
remembrance, he lay crying out all one night for fear, and at
times he would so tremble, that he would make the very bed shake
under him. <a name="citation143c"></a><a href="#footnote143c"
class="citation">[143c]</a>&nbsp; But, Oh! how the thoughts of
Death, of Hell-fire, and of eternal Judgment, did then wrack his
conscience.&nbsp; Fear might be seen in his face, and in his
tossings to and fro: It might also be heard in his words, and be
understood by his heavy groans.&nbsp; He would often cry, I am
undone, I am undone; my vile life has undone me.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Then his former atheistical thoughts and
principles, were too weak now to support him from the fears of
eternal damnation.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Aie! they were too weak indeed.&nbsp; They may
serve to stifle conscience, when a man is in the midst of his
prosperity, and to harden the heart against all good counsel when
a man is left of God, and given up to his reprobate mind: <a
name="citation143d"></a><a href="#footnote143d"
class="citation">[143d]</a> But alas, atheistical thoughts,
Notions and Opinions, must shrink and melt away, when God sends,
yea comes with sickness to visit the soul of such a sinner for
his sin.&nbsp; There was a man dwelt about 12 miles off from us,
that had so trained up himself in his atheistical Notions, that
at last he attempted to write a book against Jesus Christ, and
against the divine Authority of the Scriptures.&nbsp; (But I
think it was not printed:)&nbsp; Well, after many days God struck
him with sickness, whereof he dyed.&nbsp; So, being sick, and
musing upon his former doings, the Book that he had written came
into his mind, and with it such a sence of his evil in writing of
it, that it tore his Conscience as a Lyon would tare a Kid.&nbsp;
He lay therefore upon his death-bed in sad case, <a
name="citation144a"></a><a href="#footnote144a"
class="citation">[144a]</a> and much affliction of conscience:
some of my friends also went to see him; and as they were in his
chamber one day, he hastily called for Pen Ink and Paper, which
when it was given him, he took it and writ to this purpose.&nbsp;

<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=

</a>I, such an one, in such a Town, must goe to Hell-fire, for
writing a Book against Jesus Christ, and against the Holy
Scriptures: And would also have leaped out of the window of his
house to have killed himself, but was by them prevented of that:
so he dyed in his bed, such a death as it was.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill
be well if others take warning by him.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This is a remarkable story.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as true as remarkable; I had it from
them that I dare believe, who also themselves were eye and ear
witnesses; and also that catcht him in their arms, and saved him
when he would have leaped out of his chamber-window, to have
destroyed himself.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, you have told me what were Mr. Badmans
thoughts (now, being sick) of his condition; pray tell me also
what he then did when he was sick?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Did! he did many things, which I am sure he never
thought to have done, and which, to be sure, was not looked for
of his wife and children.</p>
<p>In this fit of sickness, his Thoughts were quite altered about
his wife; I say his Thoughts, so far as could be judged by his
words and carriages to her. <a name="citation144c"></a><a
href="#footnote144c" class="citation">[144c]</a>&nbsp; For now
she was his good wife, his godly wife, his honest wife, his duck,
and dear, and all.&nbsp; Now he told her, that she had the best
of it, she having a good Life to stand by her, while his
debaucheries and ungodly Life did always stare him in the
face.&nbsp; Now he told her, the counsel that she often gave him,
was good; though he was so bad as not to take it.</p>
<p>Now he would hear her talk to him, and he would lie sighing by
her while she so did.&nbsp; Now he would bid her pray for him,
that he might be delivered from Hell. <a
name="citation145a"></a><a href="#footnote145a"
class="citation">[145a]</a></p>
<p>He would also now consent, that some of her good Ministers
might come to him to comfort him; and he would seem to shew them
kindness when they came, for he would treat them kindly with
words, and hearken diligently to what they said, only he did not
care that they should talk much of his ill spent life, because
his conscience was clogged with that already; he cared not now to
see his old companions, the thoughts of them was a torment to
him: and now he would speak kindly to that child of his that took
after its mothers steps, though he could not at all abide it
before.</p>
<p>He also desired the prayers of good people, that God of his
mercy would spare him a little longer, promising that if God
would but let him recover this once, what a new, what a penitent
man he would be toward God, and what a loving husband he would be
to his wife: what liberty he would give her, yea how he would goe
with her himself to hear her Ministers, and how they should go
hand in hand in the way to heaven together.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Here was a fine shew of things; I&rsquo;le
warrant you, his wife was glad for this.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; His wife!&nbsp; Aie, and a many good people
besides: it was noysed all over the Town, <a
name="citation145b"></a><a href="#footnote145b"
class="citation">[145b]</a> what a great change there was wrought
upon Mr. Badman; how sorry he was for his sins, how he began to
love his wife, how he desired good men should pray to God to
spare him; and what promises he now made to God in his sickness,
that if ever he should raise him from his sick bed to health
again, what a new penitent man he would be towards God, and what
a loving husband to his good wife.</p>
<p>Well, ministers prayed, and good people rejoyced, thinking
verily that they now had gotten a man from the Devil; nay, some
of the weaker sort did not stick to say that God had began a work
of Grace in his heart; and his wife, poor woman, <a
name="citation145c"></a><a href="#footnote145c"
class="citation">[145c]</a> you cannot think how apt she was to
believe it so; she rejoyced, and she hoped as she would have
it.&nbsp; But, alas! alas! in little time things all proved
otherwise.</p>
<p>After he had kept his Bed a while, his distemper began to
abate, and he to feel himself better, so he in little time was so
finely mended, that he could walk about the house, and also
obtained a very fine stomach to his food: <a
name="citation146a"></a><a href="#footnote146a"
class="citation">[146a]</a> and now did his wife and her good
friends stand gaping, to see Mr. Badman fulfill his promise of
becoming new towards God, and loving to his wife: but the
contrary only shewed it self.&nbsp; For so soon as ever he had
hopes of mending, and found that his strength began to renew, his
trouble began to goe off his heart, and he grew as great a
stranger to his frights and fears, as if he had never had
them.</p>
<p>But verily, I am apt to think, that one reason of his no more
regarding, or remembring of his sick-bed fears, and of being no
better for them, was, some words that the Doctor that supplied
him with Physick said to him when he was mending.&nbsp; For as
soon as Mr. Badman began to mend, the Doctor comes and sits him
down by him in his house, and there fell into discourse with him
about the nature of his disease; and among other things they
talked of Badmans trouble, and how he would cry out, tremble, and
express his fears of going to Hell when his sickness lay pretty
hard upon him.&nbsp; To which the Doctor replyed: <a
name="citation146b"></a><a href="#footnote146b"
class="citation">[146b]</a> That those fears and Out-cries did
arise from the height of his distemper, for that disease was
often attended with lightness of the head, by reason the sick
party could not sleep, and for that the vapours disturbed the
brain: But you see Sir, quoth he, that so soon as you got sleep
and betook your self to rest, you quickly mended, and your head
settled, and so those frenzies left you.</p>
<p>And was it so indeed, thought Mr. Badman; was my troubles,
only the effects of my distemper, and because ill vapours got up
into my brain?&nbsp; Then surely, since my Physician was my
Saviour, my Lust again shall be my God.&nbsp; So he never minded
Religion more, but betook him again to the world, his lusts and
wicked companions: And there was an end of Mr. Badmans
Conversion.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I thought, (as you told me of him) that this
would be the result of the whole; for I discerned by your
relating of things, that the true symptoms of conversion were
wanting in him, and that those that appeared to be any thing like
them, were only such as the reprobates may have.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You say right, for there wanted in him, when he
was most sensible, a sence of the pollution of his Nature; he
only had guilt for his sinful actions, the which Cain, and
Pharaoh, and Saul, and Judas, those reprobates, have had before
him. <a name="citation147a"></a><a href="#footnote147a"
class="citation">[147a]</a></p>
<p>Besides, the great things that he desired, were, to be
delivered from going to Hell, (and who would willingly?) and that
his life might be lengthened in this world.&nbsp; We find not by
all that he said or did, that Jesus Christ the Saviour was
desired by him, from a sence of his need of his Righteousness to
cloath him, and of his Spirit to sanctifie him. <a
name="citation147b"></a><a href="#footnote147b"
class="citation">[147b]</a></p>
<p>His own strength was whole in him, he saw nothing of the
treachery of his own heart; for had he, he would never have been
so free to make promises to God of amendment.&nbsp; He would
rather have been afraid, that if he had mended, he should have
turned with the dog to his vomit, and have begged prayers of
Saints, and assistance from heaven upon that account, that he
might have been kept from doing so.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis true he did beg prayers of good people, and so did
Pharaoh of Moses and Aaron, and Simon Magus of Simon Peter. <a
name="citation147c"></a><a href="#footnote147c"
class="citation">[147c]</a></p>
<p>His mind also seemed to be turned to his wife and child; but
alas! &rsquo;twas rather from conviction that God had given him
concerning their happy estate over his, than for that he had any
true love to the work of God that was in them.&nbsp; True, some
shews of kindness he seemed to have for them, and so had rich
Dives, when in Hell, to his five brethren that were yet in the
world; yea he had such love, as to wish them in Heaven, that they
might not come thither to be tormented. <a
name="citation147d"></a><a href="#footnote147d"
class="citation">[147d]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Sick-bed Repentance is seldom good for any
thing.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You <a name="citation147e"></a><a
href="#footnote147e" class="citation">[147e]</a> say true, it is
very rarely good for any thing indeed.&nbsp; Death is unwelcom to
Nature, and usually when sickness and death visit the sinner; the
first taking of him by the shoulder, and the second standing at
the Bed-chamber door to receive him; then the sinner begins to
look about him, and to bethink with himself, These will have me
away before God; and I know that my Life has not been as it
should, how shall I do to appear before God!&nbsp; Or if it be
more the sence of the punishment, and the place of the punishment
of sinners, that also is starting to a defiled conscience, now
rouzed by deaths lumbring at the door.</p>
<p>And hence usually is sick-bed Repentance, and the matter of
it: To wit, to be saved from Hell, and from Death, and that God
will restore again to health till they mend; concluding that it
is in their power to mend, as is evident by their large and
lavishing promises to do it.</p>
<p>I have known many, that, when they have been sick, have had
large measures of this kind of Repentance, and while it has
lasted, the noyse and sound thereof, has made the Town to ring
again: but alas! how long has it lasted? oft-times scarce so long
as untill the party now sick has been well.&nbsp; It has passed
away like a mist or a vapour, it has been a thing of no
continuance.&nbsp; But this kind of Repentance is by God compared
to the howling of a dog.&nbsp; And they have not cried unto me
with their heart, when they howled upon their bed. <a
name="citation148a"></a><a href="#footnote148a"
class="citation">[148a]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Yet one may see, by this, the desperateness of
mans heart: <a name="citation148b"></a><a href="#footnote148b"
class="citation">[148b]</a> for what is it but desperate
wickedness, to make promise to God of amendment, if he will but
spare them; and yet so soon as they are recovered (or quickly
after,) fall to sin as they did before, and never to regard their
promise more.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; It is a sign of desperateness indeed; yea, of
desperate madness.&nbsp; For surely, they must needs think, that
God took notice of their promise, that he heard the words that
they spake, <a name="citation148c"></a><a href="#footnote148c"
class="citation">[148c]</a> and that he hath laid them up against
the time to come; and will then bring out, and testifie to their
faces, that they flattered him with their mouth, and lyed unto
him with their tongue, <a name="citation148d"></a><a
href="#footnote148d" class="citation">[148d]</a> when they lay
sick, to their thinking, upon their death-bed, and promised him
that if he would recover them they would repent and amend their
ways.&nbsp; But thus, as I have told you, Mr. Badman did.&nbsp;
He made great promises that he would be a New man, that he would
leave his sins, and become a Convert, that he would love, &amp;c.
his godly wife, &amp;c.&nbsp; Yea many fine words had Mr. Badman
in his sickness, but no good actions when he was well.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; And how did his good wife take it, when she saw
that he had no Amendment, but that he returned with the Dog to
his vomit, to his old courses again?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why it <a name="citation149a"></a><a
href="#footnote149a" class="citation">[149a]</a> broke her heart,
it was a worse disappointment to her than the cheat that he gave
her in marriage: At least she laid it more to heart, and could
not so well grapple with it.&nbsp; You must think that she had
put up many a prayer to God for him before, even all the time
that he had carried it so badly to her, and now when he was so
affrighted in his sickness, and so desired that he might live and
mend, poor woman, she thought that the time was come for God to
answer her prayers; nay, she did not let with gladness, to
whisper it out amongst her Friends, that &rsquo;twas so: but when
she saw her self disappointed by her husbands turning Rebel
again, she could not stand up under it, but falls into a
languishing distemper, and in a few weeks gave up the Ghost.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray how did she dye?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Die! she dyed bravely; full of comfort of the
faith of her Interest in Christ, and by him, of the world to
come: she had many brave Expressions in her sickness, and gave to
those that came to visit her many signs of her salvation; the
thoughts of the Grave, but specially of her Rising again, were
sweet thoughts to her.&nbsp; She would long for Death, because
she knew it would be her Friend.&nbsp; She behaved her self like
to some that were making of them ready to go meet their
Bridegroom. <a name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b"
class="citation">[149b]</a>&nbsp; Now, said she, I am going to
rest from my sorrows, my sighs, my tears, my mournings and
complaints: I have heretofore longed to be among the Saints, but
might by no means be suffered to goe, but now I am going, (and no
man can stop me) to the great Meeting, to the general Assembly,
and Church of the first-born which are written in Heaven. <a
name="citation149c"></a><a href="#footnote149c"
class="citation">[149c]</a>&nbsp; There I shall have my hearts
desire; there I shall worship without Temptation or other
impediment; there I shall see the face of my Jesus, whom I have
loved, whom I have served, and who now, I know, will save my
soul. <a name="citation149d"></a><a href="#footnote149d"
class="citation">[149d]</a>&nbsp; I have prayed often for my
husband, that he might be converted, but there has been no answer
of God in that matter; Are my prayers lost? are they forgotten?
are they thrown over the barr?&nbsp; No; they are hanged upon the
horns of the golden Altar, and I must have the benefit of them my
self, that moment that I shall enter into the gates, in at which
the righteous Nation that keepeth truth shall enter: I say, I
shall have the benefit of them.&nbsp; I can say as holy David; I
say, I can say of my husband, as he could of his enemies.&nbsp;
As for me, when they were sick my cloathing was of sack-cloth, I
humbled my soul with fasting, and my prayer returned into my
bosom. <a name="citation150a"></a><a href="#footnote150a"
class="citation">[150a]</a>&nbsp; My prayers are not lost, my
tears are yet in God&rsquo;s bottle; I would have had a Crown,
and Glory for my husband, and for those of my children that
follow his steps; but so far as I can see yet, I must rest in the
hope of having all my self.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Did she talk thus openly?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; No; this she spake but to one or two of her most
intimate acquaintance, who were permitted to come and see her,
when she lay languishing upon her death-bed.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, but pray go on in your relation, this is
good: I am glad to hear it, this is as a cordial to my heart
while we sit thus talking under this tree.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; When she drew near her end, she called for her
husband, and when he was come to her, she told him, <a
name="citation150b"></a><a href="#footnote150b"
class="citation">[150b]</a> That now he and she must part, and
said she, God knows, and thou shalt know, that I have been a
loving, faithful Wife unto thee; my prayers have been many for
thee; and as for all the abuses that I have received at thy hand,
those I freely and heartily forgive, and still shall pray for thy
conversion, even as long as I breathe in this world.&nbsp; But
husband, I am going thither, where no bad man shall come, and if
thou dost not convert, thou wilt never see me more with comfort;
let not my plain words offend thee: I am thy dying wife, and of
my faithfulness to thee, would leave this Exhortation with thee:
Break off thy sins, fly to God for mercy while mercies gate
stands open; remember, that the day is coming, when thou, though
now lusty and well, must lye at the gates of death, as I do: And
what wilt thou then do, if thou shalt be found with a naked soul,
to meet with the Cherubims with their flaming swords? yea, what
wilt thou then do, if Death and Hell shall come to visit thee,
and thou in thy sins, and under the Curse of the Law?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This was honest and plain: but what said Mr.
Badman to her?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; He did what he could to divert her talk, <a
name="citation151a"></a><a href="#footnote151a"
class="citation">[151a]</a> by throwing in other things; he also
shewed some kind of pity to her now, and would ask her, What she
would have? and with various kind of words put her out of her
talk; for when she see that she was not regarded, she fetcht a
deep sigh, and lay still.&nbsp; So he went down, and then she
called for her Children, and began to talk to them.&nbsp; And
first she spake to those that were rude, <a
name="citation151b"></a><a href="#footnote151b"
class="citation">[151b]</a> and told them the danger of dying
before they had grace in their hearts.&nbsp; She told them also,
that Death might be nearer them than they were aware of; and bid
them look, when they went through the Church-yard again, if there
was not little graves there.&nbsp; And, ah children, said she,
will it not be dreadful to you, if we only shall meet at the day
of Judgment, and then part again, and never see each other
more?&nbsp; And with that she wept, the Children (also) wept; so
she held on her discourse: Children, said she, I am going from
you, I am going to Jesus Christ, and with him there is neither
sorrow, nor sighing, nor pain, nor tears, nor death. <a
name="citation151c"></a><a href="#footnote151c"
class="citation">[151c]</a>&nbsp; Thither would I have you go
also, but I can neither carry you, nor fetch you thither; but if
you shall turn from your sins to God, and shall beg mercy at his
hands by Jesus Christ, you shall follow me, and shall, when you
dye, come to the place where I am going, that blessed place of
Rest: and then we shall be for ever together, beholding the face
of our Redeemer, to our mutual and eternal joy.&nbsp; So she bid
them remember the words of a dying mother when she was cold in
her grave, and themselves were hot in their sins, if perhaps her
words might put check to their vice, and that they might remember
and turn to God.</p>
<p>Then they all went down; but her <a name="citation151d"></a><a
href="#footnote151d" class="citation">[151d]</a> Darling, to wit,
the child that she had most love for, because it followed her
ways.&nbsp; So she addressed her self to that.&nbsp; Come to me,
said she, my sweet child, thou art the child of my joy: I have
lived to see thee a Servant of God; thou shalt have eternal
life.&nbsp; I, my sweet heart, shall goe before, and thou shalt
follow after; if thou shalt hold the beginning of thy confidence
stedfast to the end. <a name="citation152a"></a><a
href="#footnote152a" class="citation">[152a]</a>&nbsp; When I am
gone, do thou still remember my words, love thy Bible, follow my
Ministers, deny ungodliness still, and if troublous times shall
come, set an higher price upon Christ, his Word and Wayes, and
the testimony of a good conscience, than upon all the world
besides.&nbsp; Carry it kindly and dutifully to thy Father, but
choose none of his ways.&nbsp; If thou mayest, goe to service,
choose that, rather than to stay at home; but then be sure to
choose a service where thou mayest be helped forwards in the way
to heaven; and that thou mayest have such a service, speak to my
Minister, he will help thee, if possible, to such an one.</p>
<p>I would have thee also, my dear child, to love thy Brothers
and Sisters, but learn none of their naughty tricks.&nbsp; Have
no fellowship with the unfruitfull works of darkness, but rather
reprove them. <a name="citation152b"></a><a href="#footnote152b"
class="citation">[152b]</a>&nbsp; Thou hast Grace, they have
none: do thou therefore beautifie the way of salvation before
their eyes, by a godly life, and conformable conversation to the
revealed will of God, that thy Brothers and Sisters may see and
be the more pleased with the good wayes of the Lord.</p>
<p>If thou shalt live to marry, take heed of being served as I
was; that is, of being beguiled with fair words, and the
flatteries of a lying tongue.&nbsp; But first be sure of
godliness.&nbsp; Yea, as sure as it is possible for one to be in
this world: trust not thine own eyes, nor thine own Judgment; I
mean as to that persons godliness that thou art invited to
marry.&nbsp; Ask counsel of good men, and do nothing therein, if
he lives, without my Ministers advice.&nbsp; I have also my self
desired him to look after thee.&nbsp; Thus she talked to her
children, and gave them counsel, and after she had talked to this
a little longer, she kiss&rsquo;d it, and bid it go down.</p>
<p>Well, in short, her time drew on, and the day that she must
die.&nbsp; So she <a name="citation152c"></a><a
href="#footnote152c" class="citation">[152c]</a> died with a soul
full of Grace, an heart full of comfort, and by her death ended a
life full of trouble.&nbsp; Her husband made a Funerall for her,
perhaps because he was glad he was rid of her, but we will leave
that to be manifest at Judgment.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This Woman died well: And now we are talking of
the dying of Christians, I will tell you a story of one that died
some time since in our Town.&nbsp; The man was a godly old
Puritan, for so the godly were called in time past.&nbsp; This
man after a long, and godly life, fell sick, of the sickness,
whereof he died.&nbsp; And as he lay drawing on, the woman that
looked to him thought she heard Musick, and that the sweetest
that ever she heard in her life, which also continued untill he
gave up the Ghost: 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>now when his soul departed from him, the Musick seemed to
withdraw and to go further and further off from the house, and so
it went untill the sound was quite gone out of hearing.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; What do you think that might be?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; For ought I know, the melodious Notes of Angels,
that were sent of God to fetch him to Heaven.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I cannot say but that God goes out of his Ordinary
Road with us poor mortals sometimes.&nbsp; I cannot say this of
this woman, but yet she had better musick in her heart than
sounded in this womans ears.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I believe so; but pray tell me, did any of her
other children hearken to her words, so as to be bettered in
their souls thereby?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; One of them did, <a name="citation153b"></a><a
href="#footnote153b" class="citation">[153b]</a> and became a
very hopefull young man: but for the rest I can say nothing.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; And what did Badman do after his wife was
dead?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why even as he did before, he scarce mourned a
fortnight for her, and his mourning then was, I doubt, more in
fashion than in heart.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Would he not sometimes talk of his Wife, when she
was dead?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes, when the fit took him, and could commend her
too extremely; saying, she was a good, godly, vertuous
woman.&nbsp; But this is not a thing to be wondred at: It is
common with wicked men, to hate Gods Servants while alive, and to
commend them when they are dead.&nbsp; So served the Pharisees
the Prophets: Those of the Prophets that were dead, they
commended; and those of them that were alive they condemned. <a
name="citation153c"></a><a href="#footnote153c"
class="citation">[153c]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But did not Mr. Badman marry again quickly?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; No, not a good while after: and when he was asked
the reason, he would make this slighty answer, Who would keep a
Cow of their own, that can have a quart of milk for a penny? <a
name="citation154a"></a><a href="#footnote154a"
class="citation">[154a]</a>&nbsp; Meaning, Who would be at the
charge to have a Wife, that can have a Whore when he
listeth?&nbsp; So villanous, so abominable did he continue after
the death of his wife.&nbsp; Yet at last there was one was too
hard for him.&nbsp; For, getting of him to her upon a time, and
making of him sufficiently drunk, she was so cunning as to get a
promise of marriage of him, and so held him to it, and forced him
to marry her. <a name="citation154b"></a><a href="#footnote154b"
class="citation">[154b]</a>&nbsp; And she, as the saying is, was
as good as he, <a name="citation154c"></a><a href="#footnote154c"
class="citation">[154c]</a> at all his vile and ranting tricks:
she had her companions as well as he had his, and she would meet
them too at the Tavern and Ale-house, more commonly than he was
aware of.&nbsp; To be plain, she was a very Whore, and had as
great resort came to her, where time and place was appointed, as
any of them all.&nbsp; Aie, and he smelt it too, but could not
tell how to help it.&nbsp; For if he began to talk, she could lay
in his dish the whores that she knew he haunted, and she could
fit him also with cursing and swearing, for she would give him
Oath for Oath, and Curse for Curse.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; What kind of oaths would she have?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why damn her, and sink her, and the like.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; These are provoking things.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; So they are: but God doth not altogether let such
things goe unpunished in this life.&nbsp; Something of this I
have shewed you already, and will here give you one or two
Instances more.</p>
<p>There lived, saith one, <a name="citation154d"></a><a
href="#footnote154d" class="citation">[154d]</a> in the year
1551. in a city of Savoy, a man who was a monstrous Curser and
Swearer, and though he was often admonished and blamed for it,
yet would he by no means mend his manners.&nbsp; At length a
great plague happening in the City, he withdrew himself into a
Garden, where being again admonished to give over his wickedness,
he hardned his heart more, Swearing, Blaspheming God, and giving
himself to the Devil: And immediately the Devil snatched him up
suddenly, his wife and kinswoman looking on, and carried him
quite away.&nbsp; The Magistrates advertised hereof, went to the
place and examined the Woman, who justified the truth of it.</p>
<p>Also at Oster in the Dutchy of Magalapole, (saith Mr. Clark) a
wicked Woman, used in her cursing to give herself body and soul
to the Devil, and being reproved for it, still continued the
same; till (being at a Wedding-Feast) the Devil came in person,
and carried her up into the Air, with most horrible outcries and
roarings: And in that sort carried her round about the Town, that
the Inhabitants were ready to dye for fear: And by and by he tore
her in four pieces, leaving her four quarters in four several
high-wayes; and then brought her Bowels to the Marriage-feast,
and threw them upon the Table before the Maior of the Town,
saying, Behold, these dishes of meat belong to thee, whom the
like destruction waiteth for, if thou dost not amend thy wicked
life.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Though God forbears to deal thus with all men
that thus rend and tare his Name, and that immediate Judgments do
not overtake them; yet he makes their lives by other Judgments
bitter to them, does he not?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes, yes.&nbsp; And for proof, I need goe no
further than to this Badman and his wife; for their railing, and
cursing, and swearing ended not in words: They would fight and
fly at each other, and that like Cats and Dogs.&nbsp; But it must
be looked upon as the hand and Judgment of God upon him for his
villany; he had an honest woman before, but she would not serve
his turn, and therefore God took her away, and gave him one as
bad as himself.&nbsp; Thus that measure that he meted to his
first wife, this last did mete to him again.&nbsp; And this is a
punishment, wherewith sometimes God will punish wicked men.&nbsp;
So said Amos to Amaziah: Thy wife shall be an Harlot in the City.
<a name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a>&nbsp; With this last wife Mr. Badman
lived a pretty while; but, as I told you before, in a most sad
and hellish manner.&nbsp; And now he would bewail his first wifes
death: not of love that he had to her Godliness, for that he
could never abide, but for that she used alwayes to keep home,
whereas this would goe abroad; his first wife was also honest,
and true to that Relation, but this last was a Whore of her Body:
The first woman loved to keep things together, but this last
would whirl them about as well as he: The first would be silent
when he chid, and would take it patiently when he abused her, but
this would give him word for word, blow for blow, curse for
curse; so that now Mr. Badman had met with his match: <a
name="citation156a"></a><a href="#footnote156a"
class="citation">[156a]</a> God had a mind to make him see the
baseness of his own life, in the wickedness of his wives. <a
name="citation156b"></a><a href="#footnote156b"
class="citation">[156b]</a>&nbsp; But all would not do with Mr.
Badman, he would be Mr. Badman still: This Judgment did not work
any reformation upon him, no, not to God nor man.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I warrant you that Mr. Badman thought when his
wife was dead, that next time he would match far better.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; What he thought I cannot tell, but he could not
hope for it in this match.&nbsp; For here he knew himself to be
catcht, he knew that he was by this woman intangled, and would
therefore have gone back again, but could not.&nbsp; He knew her,
I say, to be a Whore before, and therefore could not promise
himself a happy life with her.&nbsp; For he or she that will not
be true to their own soul, will neither be true to husband nor
wife.&nbsp; And he knew that she was not true to her own soul,
and therefore could not expect she should be true to him but
Solomon says, An whore is a deep pit, and Mr. Badman found it
true.&nbsp; For when she had caught him in her pit, she would
never leave him till she had got him to promise her Marriage; and
when she had taken him so far, she forced him to marry
indeed.&nbsp; And after that, they lived that life that I have
told you.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But did not the neighbours take notice of this
alteration that Mr. Badman had made?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes; and many of his Neighbours, yea, many of
those that were carnal said, <a name="citation156c"></a><a
href="#footnote156c" class="citation">[156c]</a> &rsquo;Tis a
righteous Judgment of God upon him, for his abusive carriage and
language to his other wife: for they were all convinced that she
was a vertuous woman, and he, vile wretch, had killed her, I will
not say, with, but with the want of kindness.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; And how long I pray did they live thus
together?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Some fourteen or sixteen years, even untill
(though she also brought somthing with her) they had sinned all
away, and parted as poor as Howlets. <a
name="citation156d"></a><a href="#footnote156d"
class="citation">[156d]</a>&nbsp; And, in reason, how could it be
otherwise? he would have his way, and she would have hers; he
among his companions, and she among hers; he with his Whores, and
she with her Rogues; and so they brought their Noble to
Nine-pence.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray of what disease did Mr. Badman die, for now
I perceive we are come up to his death?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I cannot so properly say that he died of one
disease, <a name="citation157a"></a><a href="#footnote157a"
class="citation">[157a]</a> for there were many that had
consented, and laid their heads together to bring him to his
end.&nbsp; He was dropsical, he was consumptive, he was
surfeited, was gouty, and, as some say, he had a tang of the Pox
in his bowels.&nbsp; Yet the Captain of all these men of death
that came against him to take him away, was the Consumption, for
&rsquo;twas that that brought him down to the grave.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Although I will not say, but the best men may die
of a consumption, a dropsie, or a surfeit; yea, that these may
meet upon a man to end him: yet I will say again, that many times
these diseases come through mans inordinate use of things.&nbsp;
Much drinking brings dropsies, consumptions, surfeits, and many
other diseases; and I doubt, that Mr. Badman&rsquo;s death did
come by his abuse of himself in the use of lawfull and unlawfull
things.&nbsp; I ground this my sentence upon that report of his
life that you at large have given me.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I think verily that you need not call back your
sentence; for &rsquo;tis thought by many, that by his Cups and
his Queans he brought himself to this his destruction: he was not
an old man when he dyed, nor was he naturally very feeble, but
strong, and of a healthy complexion: Yet, as I said, he moultered
away, and went, when he set a going, rotten to his Grave.&nbsp;
And that which made him stink when he was dead, I mean, that made
him stink in his Name and Fame, was, that he died with a spice of
the foul disease upon him: A man whose life was full of sin, and
whose death was without repentance.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; These were blemishes sufficient to make him stink
indeed.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; They were so, and they did do it.&nbsp; No man
could speak well of him when he was gone. <a
name="citation157b"></a><a href="#footnote157b"
class="citation">[157b]</a>&nbsp; His Name rotted above ground,
as his Carkass rotted under.&nbsp; And this is according to the
saying of the wise man: The memory of the just is blessed, but
the name of the wicked shall rot. <a name="citation157c"></a><a
href="#footnote157c" class="citation">[157c]</a></p>
<p>This Text, in both the parts of it, was fulfilled upon him and
the woman that he married first.&nbsp; For her Name still did
flourish, though she had been dead almost seventeen years; but
his began to stink and rot, before he had been buried seventeen
dayes.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; That man that dieth with a life full of sin, and
with an heart void of repentance, although he should die of the
most Golden disease (if there were any that might be so called) I
will warrant him his Name shall stink, and that in Heaven and
Earth.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You say true; and therefore doth the name of Cain,
Pharaoh, Saul, Judas, and the Pharisees, though dead thousands of
years agoe, stink as fresh in the nostrils of the world as if
they were but newly dead.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I do fully acquiesce with you in this.&nbsp; But,
Sir, since you have charged him with dying impenitent, pray let
me see how you will prove it: <a name="citation158a"></a><a
href="#footnote158a" class="citation">[158a]</a> not that I
altogether doubt it, because you have affirmed it, but yet I love
to have proof for what men say in such weighty matters.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; When I said, he died without repentance, I meant,
so far as those that knew him, could judge, when they compared
his Life, the Word, and his Death together.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well said, they went the right way to find out
whether he had, that is, did manifest that he had repentance or
no.&nbsp; Now then shew me how they did prove he had none?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; So I will: And first, <a
name="citation158b"></a><a href="#footnote158b"
class="citation">[158b]</a> this was urged to prove it.&nbsp; He
had not in all the time of his sickness, a sight and sence of his
sins, but was as secure, and as much at quiet, as if he had never
sinned in all his life.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I must needs confess that this is a sign he had
none.&nbsp; For how can a man repent of that of which he hath
neither sight nor sence?&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis strange that he had
neither sight nor sence of sin now, when he had such a sight and
sence of his evil before: I mean when he was sick before.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; He was, as I said, as secure now, as if he had
been as sinless as an Angel; though all men knew what a sinner he
was, for he carried his Sins in his Forehead.&nbsp; His debauched
Life was read and known of all men; but his Reputation was read
and known of no man; for, as I said, he had none.&nbsp; And for
ought I know, the reason he had no sence of his sins now, was
because he profited not by that sence that he had of them
before.&nbsp; He liked not to retain that knowledge of God then,
that caused his sins to come to remembrance: Therefore God gave
him up now to a reprobate mind, to hardness and stupidity of
Spirit; and so was that Scripture fulfilled upon him, He hath
blinded their eyes.&nbsp; And that, Let their eyes be darkned
that they may not see. <a name="citation159a"></a><a
href="#footnote159a" class="citation">[159a]</a>&nbsp; Oh! for a
man to live in sin, and to go out of the world without Repentance
for it, is the saddest Judgement that can overtake a man.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But, Sir, although both you and I have consented
that <a name="citation159b"></a><a href="#footnote159b"
class="citation">[159b]</a> without a sight and sence of sin
there can be no Repentance, yet that is but our bare Say-so; let
us therefore now see if by the Scripture we can make it good.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; That is easily done.&nbsp; The three thousand that
were converted, (Acts the second,) repented not, till they had
sight and sence of their sins: <a name="citation159c"></a><a
href="#footnote159c" class="citation">[159c]</a> Paul repented
not till he had sight and sence of his sins: the Jailor repented
not till he had sight and sence of his sins: nor could
they.&nbsp; For of what should a man repent?&nbsp; The Answer is,
of Sin.&nbsp; What is it to Repent of sin?&nbsp; The answer is,
To be sorry for it, to turn from it. <a
name="citation159d"></a><a href="#footnote159d"
class="citation">[159d]</a>&nbsp; But how can a man be sorry for
it, that has neither sight nor sence of it.&nbsp; David did, not
only commit sins, but abode impenitent for them, untill Nathan
the Prophet was sent from God to give him a sight and sence of
them; <a name="citation159e"></a><a href="#footnote159e"
class="citation">[159e]</a> and then, but not till then, he
indeed repented of them.&nbsp; Job, in order to his Repentance,
cries unto God, Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.&nbsp;
And again, That which I see not teach thou me, I have born
chastisement, I will not offend any more: <a
name="citation159f"></a><a href="#footnote159f"
class="citation">[159f]</a> That is, not in what I know, for I
will repent of it; nor yet in what I know not, when thou shalt
shew me it.</p>
<p>Also Ephraims Repentance was after he was turned to the sight
and sence of his sins, and after he was instructed about the evil
of them. <a name="citation159g"></a><a href="#footnote159g"
class="citation">[159g]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; These are good testimonies of this truth, and doe
(if matter of fact, with which Mr. Badman is charged, be true),
prove indeed that he did not repent, but as he lived, so he dyed
in his sin: For without Repentance a man is sure to dye in his
sin; for they will lie down in the dust with him, <a
name="citation160a"></a><a href="#footnote160a"
class="citation">[160a]</a> rise at the Judgement with him, hang
about his Neck like Cords and Chains when he standeth at the
Barre of Gods Tribunal, and goe with him too when he goes away
from the Judgment-seat, with a Depart from me ye cursed into
everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels; and
there shall fret and gnaw his Conscience, because they will be to
him a never-dying worm. <a name="citation160b"></a><a
href="#footnote160b" class="citation">[160b]</a></p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You say well, and I will add a word or two more to
what I have said: Repentance, as it is not produced without a
sight and sence of sin, so every sight and sence of sin cannot
produce it: I mean, every sight and sence of sin cannot <a
name="citation160c"></a><a href="#footnote160c"
class="citation">[160c]</a> produce that Repentance, that is
Repentance unto salvation; repentance never to be repented
of.&nbsp; For it is yet fresh before us, that Mr. Badman had a
sight and sence of sin, in that fit of sickness that he had
before, but it dyed without procuring any such godly fruit; as
was manifest by his so soon returning with the Dog to his
Vomit.&nbsp; Many people think also that Repentance stands in
Confession of sin only, but they are very much mistaken: For
Repentance, as was said before, is a being sorry for, and a
turning from transgression to God by Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Now, if
this be true, that every sight and sence of sin will not produce
Repentance, then Repentance cannot be produced there where there
is no sight and sence of sin.&nbsp; That every sight and sence of
sin will not produce repentance, to wit, the godly repentance
that we are speaking of, is manifest in Cain, Pharaoh, Saul and
Judas, who all of them had sence, great sence of sin, but none of
them repentance unto life.</p>
<p>Now I conclude, that Mr. Badman did die impenitent, and so a
death most miserable.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; But pray now, before we conclude our discourse of
Mr. Badman, give me another proof of his dying in his sins.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Another proof is this. <a
name="citation160d"></a><a href="#footnote160d"
class="citation">[160d]</a>&nbsp; He did not desire a sight and
sence of sins, that he might have repentance for them.&nbsp; Did
I say he did not desire it, I will add, he greatly desired to
remain in his security: and that I shall prove by that which
follows.&nbsp; First, he could not endure that any man, now,
should talk to him of his sinfull life, and yet that was the way
to beget a sight and sence of sin, and so of repentance from it
in his soul.&nbsp; But, I say, he could not endure such
discourse.&nbsp; Those men that did offer to talk unto him of his
ill-spent Life, they were as little welcome to him in the time of
his last sickness, as was Elijah when he went to meet with Ahab,
as he went down to take possession of Naboths Vineyard.&nbsp;
Hast thou found me, said Ahab, O mine enemy? <a
name="citation161a"></a><a href="#footnote161a"
class="citation">[161a]</a>&nbsp; So would Mr. Badman say in his
heart to and of those that thus did come to him, though indeed
they came even of love, to convince him of his evil life, that he
might have repented thereof, and have obtained mercy.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Did good men then goe to see him in his last
sickness?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Yes: Those that were his first wifes acquaintance,
they went to see him, and to talk with, and to him, if perhaps he
might now, at last, bethink himself, and cry to God for
mercy.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; They did well to try now at last if they could
save his soul from Hell: But pray how can you tell that he did
not care for the company of such?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Because of the differing Carriage that he had for
them, from what he had when his old carnal companions came to see
him: When his old Campanions came to see him, he would stir up
himself as much as he could both by words and looks, to signifie
they were welcome to him; he would also talk with them freely,
and look pleasantly upon them, though the talk of such could be
none other but such as David said, carnal men would offer to him,
when they came to visit him in his sickness: If he comes to see
me, says he, he speaketh vanity, his heart gathereth iniquity to
itself. <a name="citation161b"></a><a href="#footnote161b"
class="citation">[161b]</a>&nbsp; But these kind of talks, I say,
Mr. Badman better brooked, than he did the company of better
men.</p>
<p>But I will more particularly give you a Character <a
name="citation161c"></a><a href="#footnote161c"
class="citation">[161c]</a> of his carriage to good men (and good
talk) when they came to see him.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; When they were come, he would seem to fail in his
spirits at the sight of them.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; He would not care to answer them to any of those
questions that they would at times put to him, to feel what sence
he had of sin, death, Hell, and Judgment: But would either say
nothing, or answer them by way of evasion, or else by telling of
them he was so weak and spent that he could not speak much.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; He would never shew forwardness to speak to, or talk
with them, but was glad when they held their tongues.&nbsp; He
would ask them no question about his state and another world, or
how he should escape that damnation that he had deserved.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; He had got a haunt at last to bid his wife and
keeper, when these good people attempted to come to see him, to
tell them that he was asleep or inclining to sleep, or so weak
for want thereof, that he could not abyde any noyse.&nbsp; And so
they would serve them time after time, till at last they were
discouraged from coming to see him any more.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; He was so hardned, now, in this time of his sickness,
that he would talk, when his companions came unto him, to the
disparagement of those good men (and of their good doctrine too)
that of love did come to see him, and that did labour to convert
him.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; When these good men went away from him, he would
never say, Pray when will you be pleased to come again, for I
have a desire to more of your company, and to hear more of your
good instruction?&nbsp; No not a word of that, but when they were
going would scarce bid them drink, or say, Thank you for your
good company, and good instruction.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; His talk in his sickness with his companions, would
be of the World, as Trades, Houses, Lands, great Men, great
Titles, great places, outward Prosperity, or outward Adversity,
or some such carnal thing.</p>
<p>By all which I conclude, that he did not desire a sence and
sight of his sin, that he might repent and be saved.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; It must needs be so as you say, if these things
be true that you have asserted of him.&nbsp; And I do the rather
believe them, because I think you dare not tell a lie of the
dead.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I was one of them that went to him, and that
beheld his carriage and manner of way, and this is a true
relation of it that I have given you.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I am satisfied.&nbsp; But pray if you can, shew
me now by the Word, what sentence of God doth pass upon such
men?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why, the man that is thus averse to repentance,
that desires not to hear of his sins, that he might repent and be
saved; is said to be a man that saith unto God, Depart from me,
for I desire not the knowledge of thy wayes. <a
name="citation163a"></a><a href="#footnote163a"
class="citation">[163a]</a>&nbsp; He is a man that sayes in his
heart and with his actions, I have loved strangers, (sins) and
after them I will goe.&nbsp; He is a man that shuts his eyes,
stops his ears, and that turneth his spirit against God.&nbsp;
Yea he is the man that is at enmity with God, and that abhorres
him with his soul. <a name="citation163b"></a><a
href="#footnote163b" class="citation">[163b]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; What other signe can you give me that Mr. Badman
died without repentance?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why, he did never heartily cry to God for mercy
all the time of his affliction. <a name="citation163c"></a><a
href="#footnote163c" class="citation">[163c]</a>&nbsp; True, when
sinking fits, stitches, or pains took hold upon him, then he
would say as other carnal men use to do, Lord help me, Lord
strengthen me, Lord deliver me, and the like: But to cry to God
for mercy, that he did not, but lay, as I hinted before, as if he
never had sinned.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; That is another bad sign indeed; for crying to
God for mercy, is one of the first signs of repentance.&nbsp;
When Paul lay repenting of his sin, upon his bed, the Holy Ghost
said of him, Behold he prayes. <a name="citation163d"></a><a
href="#footnote163d" class="citation">[163d]</a>&nbsp; But he
that hath not the first signs of repentance, &rsquo;tis a sign he
hath none of the other, and so indeed none at all.&nbsp; I do not
say, but there may be crying, where there may be no sign of
repentance.&nbsp; They cryed, says David, to the Lord, but he
answered them not; <a name="citation163e"></a><a
href="#footnote163e" class="citation">[163e]</a> but that he
would have done, if their cry had been the fruit of
repentance.&nbsp; But, I say, if men may cry, and yet have no
repentance, be sure, they have none, that cry not at all.&nbsp;
It is said in Job, They cry not when he bindeth them; <a
name="citation163f"></a><a href="#footnote163f"
class="citation">[163f]</a> that is, because they have no
repentance; no repentance, no cryes; false repentance, false
cryes; true repentance, true cryes.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I know that it is as possible for a man to forbear
crying that hath repentance, as it is for a man to forbear
groaning that feeleth deadly pain.&nbsp; He that looketh into the
Book of Psalms, (where repentance is most lively set forth even
in its true and proper effects,) shall there find, that crying,
strong crying, hearty crying, great crying, and uncessant crying,
hath been the fruits of repentance: (But none of this had this
Mr. Badman, therefore he dyed in his sins.)</p>
<p>That Crying is an inseparable effect of repentance, is seen in
these Scriptures.&nbsp; Have mercy upon me, O God, according to
the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my
transgressions.&nbsp; O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger,
neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.&nbsp; Have mercy upon
me, O Lord, for I am weak.&nbsp; O Lord, heal me for my bones are
vexed.&nbsp; My soul is also vexed, but thou, O Lord, how long:
Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercies sake:
O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thy hot
displeasure; for thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand
presseth me sore.&nbsp; There is no soundness in my flesh,
because of thine anger, neither is there any rest in my bones,
because of my sin.&nbsp; For mine iniquities are gone over mine
head, as an heavy burthen, they are too heavy for me.&nbsp; My
wounds stink and are corrupt; because of my foolishness.&nbsp; I
am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I goe mourning all the day
long.&nbsp; My loyns are filled with a loathsom disease, and
there is no soundness in my flesh.&nbsp; I am feeble, and sore
broken, I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
<a name="citation164a"></a><a href="#footnote164a"
class="citation">[164a]</a></p>
<p>I might give you a great number more of the holy sayings of
good men, whereby they express how they were, what they felt, and
whether they cryed or no, when repentance was wrought in
them.&nbsp; Alas, alas, it is as possible for a man, when the
pangs of Guilt are upon him to forbear praying, as it is for a
woman when pangs of travel are upon her to forbear crying.&nbsp;
If all the world should tell me that such a man hath repentance,
yet if he is not a praying man, I should not be perswaded to
believe it.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I know no reason why you should: for there is
nothing can demonstrate that such a man hath it.&nbsp; But pray
Sir, what other sign have you, by which you can prove that Mr.
Badman died in his sins, and so in a state of damnation?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I have this to prove it. <a
name="citation164b"></a><a href="#footnote164b"
class="citation">[164b]</a>&nbsp; Those who were his old sinfull
companions in the time of his health, were those whose company
and carnal talk he most delighted in, in the time of his
sickness.&nbsp; I did occasionally hint this before, but now I
make it an argument of his want of grace: for where there is
indeed a work of Grace in the heart, that work doth not only
change the heart, thoughts and desires, but the conversation
also; yea conversation and company too.&nbsp; When Paul had a
work of grace in his soul, he assayed to Joyn himself to the
Disciples.&nbsp; He was for his old companions in their
abominations no longer: he was now a Disciple, and was for the
company of Disciples.&nbsp; And he was with them coming in and
going out in Jerusalem. <a name="citation165a"></a><a
href="#footnote165a" class="citation">[165a]</a></p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I thought something when I heard you make mention
of it before.&nbsp; Thought I, this is a shrewd sign that he had
not grace in his heart.&nbsp; Birds of a feather, thought I, will
flock together: If this man was one of Gods children, he would
heard with Gods children, his delight would be with, and in the
company of Gods children.&nbsp; As David said, I am a companion
of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.
<a name="citation165b"></a><a href="#footnote165b"
class="citation">[165b]</a></p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; You say well, for what fellowship hath he that
believeth with an Infidel?&nbsp; And although it be true, that
all that joyn to the godly are not godly, yet they that shall
inwardly choose the company of the ungodly and open profane,
rather than the company of the godly, as Mr. Badman did; surely
are not godly men, but profane.&nbsp; He was, as I told you, out
of his element, when good men did come to visit him, but then he
was where he would be, when he had his vain companions about
him.&nbsp; Alas! grace, as I said, altereth all, heart, life,
company, and all; for by it the heart and man is made new: and a
new heart, a new man, must have objects of delight that are new,
and like himself: Old things are passed away; Why?&nbsp; For all
things are become new. <a name="citation165c"></a><a
href="#footnote165c" class="citation">[165c]</a>&nbsp; Now if all
things are become new, to wit, heart, mind, thoughts, desires,
and delights, it followeth by consequence that the company must
be answerable: hence it is said, That they that believed were
together; that they went to their own company; that they were
added to the Church; that they were of one heart and of one soul;
<a name="citation165d"></a><a href="#footnote165d"
class="citation">[165d]</a> and the like.&nbsp; Now if it be
objected that Mr. Badman was sick, and so could not goe to the
godly, yet he had a tongue in his head, and could, had he had an
heart, have spoken to some to call or send for the godly to come
to him.&nbsp; Yea, he would have done so; yea the company of all
others, specially his fellow sinners, would, even in every
appearance of them before him, have been a burden and a grief
unto him.&nbsp; His heart and affection standing bent to good,
good companions would have suited him best.&nbsp; But his
Companions were his old Associates, his delight was in them,
therefore his heart and soul were yet ungodly.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray how was he when he drew near his end? for I
perceive that what you say of him now, hath reference to him, and
to his actions, at the beginning of his sickness?&nbsp; Then he
could endure company, and much talk; besides, perhaps then he
thought he should recover and not die, as afterwards he had cause
to think, when he was quite wasted with pining sickness, when he
was at the graves mouth.&nbsp; But how was he, I say, when he was
(as we say) at the graves mouth, within a step of death? when he
saw, and knew, and could not but know, that shortly he must dye,
and appear before the Judgment of God?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why <a name="citation166a"></a><a
href="#footnote166a" class="citation">[166a]</a> there was not
any other alteration in him, than what was made by his disease
upon his body: sickness, you know, will alter the body, also
pains and stitches will make men groan; but for his mind he had
no alteration there.&nbsp; His mind was the same, his heart was
the same.&nbsp; He was the self-same Mr. Badman still: not onely
in Name but Conditions, and that to the very day of his death:
yea, so far as could be gathered to the very moment in which he
died.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray how was he in his death? was Death strong
upon him? or did he dye with ease, quietly?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; As quietly as a <a name="citation166b"></a><a
href="#footnote166b" class="citation">[166b]</a> Lamb.&nbsp;
There seemed not to be in it, to standers by, so much as a strong
struggle of Nature: and as for his Mind, it seemed to be wholly
at quiet.&nbsp; But pray why do you ask me this question?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Not for mine own sake, but for others.&nbsp; For
there is such <a name="citation166c"></a><a href="#footnote166c"
class="citation">[166c]</a> an opinion as this among the
ignorant: That if a man dies, as they call it, like a Lamb, that
is, quietly, and without that consternation of mind that others
shew in their death, they conclude, and that beyond all doubt,
that such an one is gone to Heaven, and is certainly escaped the
wrath to come.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; There is no Judgment to be made by a quiet death,
of the Eternal state of him that so dieth.&nbsp; Suppose one man
should die quietly, another should die suddenly, and a third
should die under great consternation of spirit; no man can Judge
of their eternall condition by the manner of any of these kinds
of deaths.&nbsp; He that dies quietly, suddenly, or under
consternation of spirit, may goe to Heaven, or may goe to Hell;
no man can tell whether a man goes, by any such manner of
death.&nbsp; The <a name="citation167a"></a><a
href="#footnote167a" class="citation">[167a]</a> Judgment
therefore that we make of the eternall condition of a man must be
gathered from another consideration: To wit, Did the man die in
his sins? did he die in unbelief? did he die before he was born
again? then he is gone to the Devil and hell, though he died
never so quietly.&nbsp; Again, Was the man a good man? had he
faith and holiness? was he a lover and a Worshipper of God by
Christ, according to his Word?&nbsp; Then he is gone to God and
Heaven, how suddenly, or in what consternation of mind soever he
died: But Mr. Badman was naught, his life was evil, his wayes
were evil; evil to his end: he therefore went to Hell and to the
Devil, how quietly soever he died.</p>
<p>Indeed there is, in some cases, a Judgment to be made of a
mans eternal condition by the manner of the death he dieth. <a
name="citation167b"></a><a href="#footnote167b"
class="citation">[167b]</a>&nbsp; As suppose now a man should
murder himself, or live a wicked life, and after that die in
utter despair; these men without doubt do both of them goe to
Hell.&nbsp; And here I will take an occasion to speak of two of
Mr. Badmans Brethren, (for you know I told you before that he had
Brethren,) and of the manner of their death.&nbsp; One of them
killed himself, and the other after a wicked life died in utter
despair.&nbsp; Now I should not be afraid to conclude of both
these, that they went by, and through their death to hell.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Pray tell me concerning the first, how he made
away himself?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Why, he took a knife and cut his own Throat, and
immediately gave up the Ghost and died.&nbsp; Now what can we
judge of such a mans condition; since the Scripture saith, No
murderer hath eternall life, &amp;c. but that it must be
concluded, that such an one is gone to Hell.&nbsp; He was a
murderer, a Self-murderer; and he is the worst murderer, one that
slays his own body and soul: nor doe we find mention made of any
but cursed ones that doe such kind of deeds.&nbsp; I say, no
mention made in holy Writ of any others, but such, that murder
themselves.</p>
<p>And this is the sore Judgment of God upon men, when God shall,
for the sins of such, give them up to be their own Executioners,
or rather to execute his Judgment and Anger upon
themselves.&nbsp; And let me earnestly give this Caution to
sinners.&nbsp; Take heed, Sirs, break off your sins, lest God
serves you as he served Mr. Badmans Brother: That is, lest he
gives you up to be your own Murderers.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Now you talk of this.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=

</a>I did once know a man, a Barber, that took his own Raisor,
and cut his own Throat, and then put his head out of his
Chamber-window, to shew the neighbours what he had done, and
after a little while died.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"

</a>I can tell you a more dreadful thing than this: I mean as to
the manner of doing the fact. <a name="citation168c"></a><a
href="#footnote168c" class="citation">[168c]</a>&nbsp; There was
about twelve years since, a man that lived at Brafield by
Northampton, (named John Cox) that murdered himself; the manner
of his doing of it was thus.&nbsp; He was a poor man, and had for
some time been sick (and the time of his sickness was about the
beginning of Hay-time;) and taking too many thoughts how he
should live afterwards, if he lost his present season of work, he
fell into deep despair about the world, and cryed out to his wife
the morning before he killed himself, saying, We are
undone.&nbsp; But quickly after, he desired his wife to depart
the room, Because, said he, I will see if I can get any rest; so
she went out: but he instead of sleeping, quickly took his
Raisor, and therewith cut up a great hole in his side, out of
which he pulled, and cut off some of his guts, and threw them,
with the blood up and down the Chamber.&nbsp; But this not
speeding of him so soon as he desired, he took the same Raisor
and therewith cut his own throat.&nbsp; His wife then hearing of
him sigh and fetch his wind short, came again into the room to
him, and seeing what he had done, she ran out and called in some
Neighbours, who came to him where he lay in a bloody manner,
frightfull to behold.&nbsp; Then said one of them to him, Ah!
John, what have you done? are you not sorry for what you have
done?&nbsp; He answered roughly, &rsquo;Tis too late to be
sorry.&nbsp; Then said the same person to him again, Ah! John,
pray to God to forgive thee this bloody act of thine.&nbsp; At
the hearing of which Exhortation, he seemed much offended, and in
angry manner said, Pray! and with that flung himself away to the
wall, and so after a few gasps died desperately.&nbsp; When he
had turned him of his back, to the wall, the blood ran out of his
belly as out of a boul, and soaked quite through the bed to the
boards, and through the chinks of the boards it ran pouring down
to the ground.&nbsp; Some said, that when the neighbours came to
see him, he lay groaping with his hand in his bowels, reaching
upward, as was thought, that he might have pulled or cut out his
heart.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas said also, that some of his Liver had
been by him torn out and cast upon the boards, and that many of
his guts hung out of the bed on the side thereof.&nbsp; But I
cannot confirm all particulars; but the general of the story,
with these circumstances above mentioned, is true; I had it from
a sober and credible person, who himself was one that saw him in
this bloody state, and that talked with him, as was hinted
before.</p>
<p>Many other such dreadful things might be told you, but these
are enough, and too many too, if God in his wisdom had thought
necessary to prevent them.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This is a dreadful Story: and I would to God that
it might be a warning to others to instruct them to fear before
God, and pray, lest he gives them up to doe as John Cox hath
done.&nbsp; For surely self-murderers cannot goe to Heaven: and
therefore, as you have said, he that dieth by his own hands, is
certainly gone to Hell.&nbsp; But speak a word or two of the
other man you mentioned.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; What? of a wicked man dying in Despair?</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Yes, of a wicked man dying in despair.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Well then: <a name="citation169a"></a><a
href="#footnote169a" class="citation">[169a]</a> This Mr. Badmans
other Brother was a very wicked man, both in Heart and Life; I
say in Heart, because he was so in Life, nor could anything
reclaim him; neither good Men, good Books, good Examples, nor
Gods Judgements.&nbsp; Well, after he had lived a great while in
his sins, God smote with a sickness of which he died.&nbsp; Now
in his sickness his Conscience began to be awakened, and he began
to roar out of his ill-spent Life, insomuch that the Town began
to ring of him.&nbsp; Now when it was noysed about, many of the
Neighbours came to see him, and to read by him, as is the common
way with some; but all that they could doe, 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>could not abate his terror, but he would lie in his Bed
gnashing of his teeth, and wringing of his wrists, concluding
upon the Damnation of his Soul, and in that horror and despair he
dyed; not calling upon God, but distrusting in his Mercy, and
Blaspheming of his Name.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This brings to my mind a man that a Friend of
mine told me of.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/tnb.jpg">
<img alt=
"Take note symbol"
title=
"Take note symbol"
src="images/tns.jpg" />
</a>He had been a wicked liver; so when he came to die, he fell
into despair, and having concluded that God had no mercy for him
he addressed himself to the Devil for favour, saying, Good Devil
be good unto me.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; This is almost like Saul, who being forsaken of
God, went to the Witch of Endor, and so to the Devil for help. <a
name="citation170a"></a><a href="#footnote170a"
class="citation">[170a]</a>&nbsp; But alas, should I set my self
to collect these dreadful Stories, it would be easie in little
time to present you with hundreds of them: But I will conclude as
I began; They that are their own Murderers, or that die in
Despair, after they have lived a life of wickedness, do surely go
to Hell.</p>
<p>And here I would put in a Caution: Every one that dieth under
consternation of spirit; that is, under amazement and great fear,
do not therefore die in Despair: For a good man may have this for
his bands in his death, and yet go to Heaven and Glory.&nbsp;
For, as I said before, He that is a good man, a man that hath
Faith and Holiness, a lover and Worshipper of God by Christ,
according to his Word, may die in consternation of spirit: for
Satan will not be wanting to assault good men upon their
death-bed, but they are secured by the Word and Power of God;
yea, and are also helped, though with much agony of spirit, to
exercise themselves in Faith and Prayer, the which he that dieth
in Despair, can by no means doe.&nbsp; But let us return to Mr.
Badman, and enter further Discourse of the manner of his
Death.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; I think you and I are both of a mind; for just
now I was thinking to call you back to him also.&nbsp; And pray
now, since it is your own motion to return again to him, let us
discourse a little more of his quiet and still death.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; With all my heart.&nbsp; You know we were speaking
before of the manner of Mr. Badmans death: <a
name="citation171a"></a><a href="#footnote171a"
class="citation">[171a]</a> How that he dyed very stilly and
quietly; upon which you made observation, that the common people
conclude, that if a man dyes quietly, and as they call it, like a
Lamb, he is certainly gone to Heaven: when alas, if a wicked man
dyes quietly, if a man that has all his dayes lived in notorious
sin, dyeth quietly; his quiet dying is so far off from being a
sign of his being saved, that it is an uncontrollable proof of
his damnation.&nbsp; This was Mr. Badmans case, he lived wickedly
even to the last, and then went quietly out of the world:
therefore Mr. Badman is gone to Hell.</p>
<p>Att.&nbsp; Well, but since you are upon it, and also so
confident in it, to wit, that a man that lives a wicked life till
he dyes, and then dyes quietly, is gone to Hell; let me see hat
shew of proof you have for this your opinion.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; My first argument is drawn from the Necessity of
repentance: No man can be saved except he repents, nor can he
repent that sees not, that knows not that he is a sinner, and he
that knows himself to be a sinner, will, I will warrant him, be
molested for the time by that knowledge. <a
name="citation171b"></a><a href="#footnote171b"
class="citation">[171b]</a>&nbsp; This, as it is testified by all
the Scriptures, so it is testified by Christian experience.&nbsp;
He that knows of himself to be a sinner, is molested, especially
if that knowledge comes not to him untill he is cast upon his
death-bed; molested, I say, before he can dye quietly.&nbsp; Yea,
he is molested, dejected and cast down, he is also made to cry
out, to hunger and thirst after mercy by Christ, and if at all he
shall indeed come to die quietly, I mean with that quietness that
is begotten by Faith and Hope in Gods mercy (to the which Mr.
Badman and his brethren were utter strangers,) his quietness is
distinguished by all Judicious observers, by what went before it,
by what it flows from, and also by what is the fruit thereof.</p>
<p>I must confess I am no admirer of sick-bed repentance, for I
think verily it is seldom <a name="citation171c"></a><a
href="#footnote171c" class="citation">[171c]</a> good for any
thing: but I say, he that hath lived in sin and profaneness all
his dayes, as Mr. Badman did, and yet shall dye quietly, that is,
without repentance steps in &rsquo;twixt his life and death, he
is assuredly gone to Hell, and is damned.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This does look like an argument indeed; for
Repentance must come, or else we must goe to Hell-fire: and if a
lewd liver shall (I mean that so continues till the day of his
death), yet goe out of the world quietly, &rsquo;tis a sign that
he died without repentance, and so a sign that he is damned.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I am satisfied in it, for my part, and that from
the Necessity, and Nature of repentance.&nbsp; It is necessary,
because God calls for it, and will not pardon sin without it:
Except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish.&nbsp; This is that
which God hath said, and he will prove but a fool-hardy man that
shall yet think to goe to Heaven and glory without it.&nbsp;
Repent, for the Ax is laid to the root of the tree, every tree
therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit, (but no good fruit
can be where there is not sound repentance) shall be hewn down,
and cast into the fire. <a name="citation172a"></a><a
href="#footnote172a" class="citation">[172a]</a>&nbsp; This was
Mr. Badmans case, he had attending of him a sinfull life, and
that to the very last, and yet dyed quietly, that is, without
repentance; he is gone to Hell and is damned.&nbsp; For the
Nature of repentance, I have touched upon that already, and
shewed, that it never was where a quiet death is the immediate
companion of a sinfull life; and therefore Mr. Badman is gone to
Hell.</p>
<p>Secondly, <a name="citation172b"></a><a href="#footnote172b"
class="citation">[172b]</a> My second argument is drawn from that
blessed Word of Christ, While the strong man armed keeps the
house, his goods are in peace, till a stronger than he comes: but
the strong man armed kept Mr. Badmans house, that is, his heart,
and soul, and body, for he went from a sinfull life quietly, out
of this world: the stronger did not disturb by intercepting with
sound repentance, betwixt his sinful life and his quiet death:
Therefore Mr. Badman is gone to Hell.</p>
<p>The strong man armed is the Devil, and quietness is his
security.&nbsp; The Devil never fears losing of the sinner, if he
can but keep him quiet: can he but keep him quiet in a sinfull
life, and quiet in his death, he is his own.&nbsp; Therefore he
saith, his goods are in peace; that is, out of danger.&nbsp;
There is no fear of the Devils losing such a soul, I say, because
Christ, who is the best Judge in this matter, saith, his goods
are in peace, in quiet, and out of danger.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; This is a good one too; <a
name="citation173a"></a><a href="#footnote173a"
class="citation">[173a]</a> for doubtless, peace and quiet with
sin, is one of the greatest signs of a damnable state.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; So it is.&nbsp; Therefore, when God would shew the
greatness of his anger against sin and sinners in one word, he
saith, They are joyned to Idols, let them alone. <a
name="citation173b"></a><a href="#footnote173b"
class="citation">[173b]</a>&nbsp; Let them alone, that is,
disturb them not; let them goe on without controll; let the Devil
enjoy them peaceably, let him carry them out of the world
unconverted quietly.&nbsp; This is one of the sorest of
Judgments, and bespeaketh the burning anger of God against
sinfull men.&nbsp; See also when you come home, the fourteenth
Verse of the Chapter last mentioned in the Margent: I will not
punish your daughters when they commit Whoredom.&nbsp; I will let
them alone, they shall live and dye in their sins.&nbsp; But,</p>
<p>Thirdly, My third argument <a name="citation173c"></a><a
href="#footnote173c" class="citation">[173c]</a> is drawn from
that saying of Christ: He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened
their hearts; that they should not see with their eyes, nor
understand with their hearts, and be converted, and I should heal
them. <a name="citation173d"></a><a href="#footnote173d"
class="citation">[173d]</a></p>
<p>There are three things that I will take notice of from these
words.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The first is, That there can be no conversion to God
where the eye is darkned, and the heart hardened.&nbsp; The eye
must first be made to see, and the heart to break and relent
under and for sin, or else there can be no conversion.&nbsp; He
hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their hearts, lest they
should see, and understand and (So) be converted.&nbsp; And this
was clearly Mr. Badmans case, he lived a wicked life, and also
died with his eyes shut, and heart hardened, as is manifest, in
that a sinful life was joyned with a quiet death; and all for
that he should not be converted, but partake of the fruit of his
sinfull life in Hell fire.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The second thing that I take notice of from these
words is, That this is a dispensation and manifestation of Gods
anger against a man for his sin.&nbsp; When God is angry with
men, I mean, when he is so angry with them, this among many is
one of the Judgments that he giveth them up unto, to wit, to
blindness of mind, and hardness of heart, which he also suffereth
to accompany them till they enter in at the gates of death.&nbsp;
And then, and there, and not short of then and there, their eyes
come to be opened.&nbsp; Hence it is said of the rich man
mentioned in Luke, He dyed, and in Hell he lifted up his eyes: <a
name="citation174a"></a><a href="#footnote174a"
class="citation">[174a]</a> Implying that he did not lift them up
before: He neither saw what he had done, nor whither he was
going, till he came to the place of execution, even into
Hell.&nbsp; He died asleep in his soul; he dyed bespotted,
stupified, and so consequently for quietness, like a Child or
Lamb, even as Mr. Badman did: this was a sign of Gods anger; he
had a mind to damn him for his sins, and therefore would not let
him see nor have an heart to repent for them, lest he should
convert, and his damnation, which God had appointed, should be
frustrate: lest they should be converted, and I should heal
them.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The third thing that I take notice of from hence, is,
That a sinfull life and a quiet death annexed to it, is the
ready, the open, the beaten, the common high-way to Hell: there
is no surer sign of Damnation, than for a man to dye quietly
after a sinfull life.&nbsp; I do not say that all wicked men,
that are molested at their death with a sence of sin and fears of
Hell, do therefore goe to Heaven, (for some are also made to see,
and are left to despair (not converted by seeing) that they might
go roaring out of this world to their place:)&nbsp; But I say,
there is no surer sign of a mans Damnation, than to dye quietly
after a sinful life; than to sin, and dye with his eyes shut;
than to sin, and dye with an heart that cannot repent.&nbsp; He
hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they
should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart;
(no, not so long as they are in this world) lest they should see
with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and should be
converted, and I should heal them. <a name="citation174b"></a><a
href="#footnote174b" class="citation">[174b]</a></p>
<p>God has a Judgment for wicked men; God will be even with
wicked men: God knows how to reserve the ungodly to the day of
Judgment to be punished: <a name="citation174c"></a><a
href="#footnote174c" class="citation">[174c]</a> And this is one
of his wayes by which he doth it.&nbsp; Thus it was with Mr.
Badman.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Fourthly, <a name="citation174d"></a><a
href="#footnote174d" class="citation">[174d]</a> It is said in
the Book of Psalms, concerning the wicked, There is no bands in
their death, but their strength is firm.&nbsp; By no bands, he
means no troubles, no gracious chastisements, no such corrections
for sin as fall to be the Lot of Gods people for theirs; yea,
that many times falls to be theirs, at the time of their
death.&nbsp; Therefore he adds concerning the wicked, They are
not troubled (then) like other men, neither are they plagued like
other men; but go as securely out of the world, as if they had
never sinned against God, and put their own souls into danger of
damnation.&nbsp; There is no band in their death.&nbsp; They seem
to go unbound, and set at liberty, out of this world, though they
have lived notoriously wicked all their dayes in it.&nbsp; The
Prisoner that is to dye at the Gallows for his wickedness, must
first have his Irons knock&rsquo;t off his legs; so he seems to
goe most at liberty, when indeed he is going to be executed for
his transgressions.&nbsp; Wicked men also have no bands in their
death, they seem to be more at liberty when they are even at the
Wind-up of their sinfull life, than at any time besides.</p>
<p>Hence you shall have them boast of their Faith and Hope in
Gods Mercy, when they lye upon their death-bed; yea, you shall
have them speak as confidently of their salvation, as if they had
served God all their dayes: when the truth is, the bottom of this
their boasting is, because they have no bands in their death.</p>
<p>Their sin and base life comes not into their mind to correct
them, and bring them to repentance; but presumptuous thoughts,
and an hope and faith of the Spiders (the Devils) making,
possesseth their soul, to their own eternal undoing. <a
name="citation175a"></a><a href="#footnote175a"
class="citation">[175a]</a></p>
<p>Hence wicked mens hope, is said to dye, not before, but with
them; they give up the Ghost together.&nbsp; And thus did Mr.
Badman.&nbsp; His sins and his hope went with him to the Gate,
but there his hope left him, because it dyed there; but his sins
went in with him, to be a worm to gnaw him in his conscience for
ever and ever.</p>
<p>The opinion therefore of the common people concerning this
kind of dying, is <a name="citation175b"></a><a
href="#footnote175b" class="citation">[175b]</a> frivolous and
vain; for Mr. Badman died like a Lamb, or as they call it, like a
Chrisom child, quietly and without fear.&nbsp; I speak not this
with reference to the strugling of nature with death, but as to
the strugling of the conscience with the Judgment of God.&nbsp; I
know that Nature will struggle with death.&nbsp; I have seen a
Dog and Sheep dye hardly: And thus may a wicked man doe, because
there is an antipathy betwixt nature and death.&nbsp; But even
while, even then, when Death and Nature are strugling for
mastery, the soul, the conscience, may be as besotted, as
benummed, as senceless and ignorant of its miserable state, as
the block or bed on which the sick lyes: And thus they may dye
like a Chrisom child in shew, but indeed like one who by the
Judgment of God is bound over to eternal damnation; and that also
by the same Judgment is kept from seeing what they are, and
whither they are going, till they plunge down among the
flames.</p>
<p>And as it is a very great Judgment of God on wicked men that
so dye, (for it cuts them off from all possibility of repentance,
and so of salvation) <a name="citation176a"></a><a
href="#footnote176a" class="citation">[176a]</a> so it is as
great a Judgment upon those that are their companions that
survive them.&nbsp; For by the manner of their death, they dying
so quietly, so like unto chrisom children, as they call it, they
are hardened, and take courage to go on in their course.</p>
<p>For comparing their life with their death, their sinful cursed
lives with their child-like, Lamb-like death, they think that all
is well, that no damnation is happened to them; Though they lived
like Devils incarnate, yet they dyed like harmless ones.&nbsp;
There was no whirl-wind, no tempest, no band, nor plague in their
death: They dyed as quietly as the most godly of them all, and
had as great faith and hope of salvation, and would talk as
boldly of salvation as if they had assurance of it.&nbsp; But as
was their hope in life, so was their death: Their hope was
without tryal, because it was none of Gods working, and their
death was without molestation, because so was the Judgment of God
concerning them.</p>
<p>But I say, at this their survivors take heart to tread their
steps, and to continue to live in the breach of the Law of God;
yea they carry it statelily in their villanies; for so it follows
in the Psalm.&nbsp; There is no bands in their death, but their
strength is firm, &amp;c.&nbsp; Therefore pride compasseth them
(the survivors) about as a chain, violence covereth them as a
garment. <a name="citation176b"></a><a href="#footnote176b"
class="citation">[176b]</a>&nbsp; Therefore they take courage to
do evil, therefore they pride themselves in their iniquity.&nbsp;
Therefore, Wherefore?&nbsp; Why, because their fellows died,
after they had lived long in a most profane and wicked life, as
quietly and as like to Lambs, as if they had been innocent.</p>
<p>Yea, they are bold, by seeing this, to conclude, that God,
either does not, or will not take notice of their sins.&nbsp;
They speak wickedly, they speak loftily.&nbsp; They speak
wickedly of sin, for that they make it better than by the Word it
is pronounced to be.&nbsp; They speak wickedly concerning
oppression, that they commend, and count it a prudent act.&nbsp;
They also speak loftily: They set their mouth against the
Heavens, &amp;c.&nbsp; And they say, How doth God know, and is
there knowledge in the most High?&nbsp; And all this, so far as I
can see, ariseth in their hearts from the beholding of the quiet
and lamb-like death of their companions. <a
name="citation177a"></a><a href="#footnote177a"
class="citation">[177a]</a></p>
<p>Behold these are the ungodly that prosper in the world, <a
name="citation177b"></a><a href="#footnote177b"
class="citation">[177b]</a> (that is, by wicked ways) they
increase in riches.</p>
<p>This therefore is a great Judgment of God, both upon that man
that dyeth in his sins, and also upon his companion that
beholdeth him so to dye.&nbsp; He sinneth, he dyeth in his sins,
and yet dyeth quietly.&nbsp; What shall his companion say to
this?&nbsp; What Judgment shall he make how God will deal with
him, by beholding the lamb-like death of his companion?&nbsp; Be
sure, he cannot, as from such a sight say, Wo be to me, for
Judgment is before him: He cannot gather, that sin is a dreadful
and a bitter thing, by the child-like death of Mr. Badman.&nbsp;
But must rather, if he judgeth according to what he sees, or
according to his corrupted reason, conclude with the wicked ones
of old, That every one that doth evil, is good in the sight of
the Lord, and he delighteth in them; or where is the God of
Judgment? <a name="citation177c"></a><a href="#footnote177c"
class="citation">[177c]</a></p>
<p>Yea, this is enough to puzzle the wisest man.&nbsp; David
himself, was put to a stand, by beholding the quiet death of
ungodly men.&nbsp; Verily, sayes he, I have cleansed my heart in
vain, and have washed my hands in innocency.&nbsp; Psal. 73.
13.&nbsp; They, to appearance fare better by far than I: Their
eyes stand out with fatness, they have more than heart can wish;
But all the day long have I been plagued, and chastned every
morning.&nbsp; This, I say, made David wonder, yea, and Job and
Jeremiah too: But he goeth into the Sanctuary, and then he
understands their end, nor could he understand it before.&nbsp; I
went into the Sanctuary of God: What place was that? why there
where he might enquire of God, and by him be resolved of this
matter: Then, says he, understood I their end.&nbsp; Then I saw,
that thou hast set them in slippery places, and that thou castest
them down to destruction.&nbsp; Castest them down, that is,
suddenly, or as the next words say, As in a moment they are
utterly consumed with terrors: which terrors did not cease them
on their sick-bed, for they had no bands in their death.&nbsp;
The terrors therefore ceased them there, where also they are
holden in them for ever.&nbsp; This he found out, I say, but not
without great painfulness, grief and pricking in his reins: so
deep, so hard and so difficult did he find it, rightly to come to
a determination in this matter.</p>
<p>And indeed, this is a deep Judgment of God towards ungodly
sinners; it is enough to stagger a whole world, only the Godly
that are in the world have a Sanctuary to go to, where the Oracle
and Word of God is, by which his Judgements, and a reason of many
of them are made known to, and understood by them.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Indeed this is a staggering dispensation.&nbsp;
It is full of the wisdom and anger of God.&nbsp; And I believe,
as you have said, that it is full of Judgment to the world.&nbsp;
Who would have imagined, that had not known Mr. Badman, and yet
had seen him die, but that he had been a man of an holy life and
conversation, since he died so stilly, so quietly, so like a Lamb
or Chrisom child?&nbsp; Would they not, I say, have concluded,
that he was a righteous man? or that if they had known him and
his life, yet to see him die so quietly, would they not have
concluded that he had made his peace with God?&nbsp; Nay further,
if some had known that he had died in his sins, and yet that he
died so like a Lamb, would they not have concluded, that either
God doth not know our sins, or that he likes them; or that he
wants power, or will, or heart, or skill to punish them; since
Mr. Badman himself went from a sinfull life so quietly, so
peaceably, and so like a Lamb as he did?</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; Without controversie, this is an heavy judgment of
God upon wicked men; (Job 21. 23) one goes to Hell in peace,
another goes to Hell in trouble; one goes to Hell being sent
thither by his own hands; another goes to Hell, being sent
thither by the hand of his companion; one goes thither with his
eyes shut, and another goes thither with his eyes open; one goes
thither roaring, and another goes thither boasting of Heaven and
Happiness all the way he goes: One goes thither like Mr. Badman
himself, and others go thither as did his Brethren.&nbsp; But
above all, Mr. Badmans death, as to the manner of dying, is the
fullest of Snares and Traps to wicked men; therefore they that
die as he, are the greatest stumble to the world: They goe, and
goe, they go on peaceably from Youth to old Age, and thence to
the Grave, and so to Hell, without noyse: They goe as an Ox to
the slaughter, and as a fool to the correction of the Stocks;
that is, both sencelesly and securely.&nbsp; O! but being come at
the gates of Hell!&nbsp; O! but when they see those gates set
open for them: O! but when they see that that is their home, and
that they must go in thither, then their peace and quietness
flies away for ever: Then they roar like Lions, yell like
Dragons, howl like Dogs, and tremble at their Judgment, as do the
Devils themselves.&nbsp; Oh! when they see they must shoot the
Gulf and Throat of Hell! when they shall see that Hell hath shut
her ghastly Jaws upon them! when they shall open their eyes, and
find themselves within the belly and bowels of Hell! then they
will mourn, and weep, and hack, and gnash their teeth for
pain.&nbsp; But this must not be (or if it must, yet very rarely)
till they are gone out of the sight and hearing of those mortals
whom they do leave behind them alive in the world.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Well, my good Neighbour Wiseman, I perceive that
the Sun grows low, and that you have come to a conclusion with
Mr. Badmans Life and Death; and therefore I will take my leave of
you.&nbsp; Only first, let me tell you, I am glad that I have met
with you to day, and that our hap was to fall in with Mr. Badmans
state.&nbsp; I also thank you for your freedom with me, in
granting of me your reply to all my questions: I would only beg
your Prayers; that God will give me much grace, that I may
neither live nor die as did Mr. Badman.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; My good Neighbour Attentive, I wish your welfare
in Soul and Body; and if ought that I have said of Mr. Badmans
Life and-Death, may be of Benefit unto you, I shall be heartily
glad; only I desire you to thank God for it, and to pray heartily
for me, that I with you may be kept by the Power of God through
Faith unto Salvation.</p>
<p>Atten.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; Farewell.</p>
<p>Wise.&nbsp; I wish you heartily Farewell.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
